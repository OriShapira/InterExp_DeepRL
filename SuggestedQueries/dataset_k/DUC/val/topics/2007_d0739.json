            "But are sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth thousands of dollars ?",
            "As they say on television , stay tuned .",
            "On June 18 , little more than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from `` Seinfeld '' went the way of the barroom busybodies on `` Cheers '' and the medics on `` MASH , '' Christie 's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page script with all the `` alrights . ''",
            "Christie 's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 .",
            "But some television-memorabilia dealers , like Robert Schagrin of the Got ta Have It gallery in Manhattan , maintain that the bidding could easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood collectibles is blossoming .",

            "Just as location , location , location is a mantra in real estate , television-script dealers value autographs , autographs , autographs .",
            "The `` Seinfeld '' script in the Christie 's East sale bears the signatures of the four principal cast members ( not Larry David , who wrote it ) .",

            "Again , value is tied to autographs : Schagrin guessed that if a signed `` Honeymooners '' script existed , it would be worth more than $ 50,000 .",
            "`` God , that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music to ` The White Album , ' '' he said .",
            "Last year , a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of `` This Is Your Life '' went for $ 1,150 .",

            "Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than other film and television collectibles .",
            "A script for an episode of `` MASH , '' signed by the entire cast , sold for $ 700 in 1995 ; earlier this year , it went for $ 4,000 .",
            "A signed script from the NBC sitcom `` Friends '' that sold for $ 550 in 1996 sold recently for $ 1,800 .",
            "And a `` Cheers '' script sold for $ 900 soon after that long-running sitcom went off the air in 1993 .",
            "The owner recently put it on the market for $ 5,000 .",
            "`` We did n't sell it , '' Schagrin said .",

            "And it meant we wasted that 9:30 slot behind ` Seinfeld ' instead of finding the hit that could help replace it . ''",
