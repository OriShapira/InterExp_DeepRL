            "Thousands more are still missing and hundreds of thousands are homeless as a result of that quake .",
            "Tuesday 's tremor , which shook the Earth back and forth for about 10 seconds , struck shortly after 11 a.m. and was followed by an aftershock about 20 minutes later .",
            "The principal observatory in Istanbul said the first tremor measured 5.2 on the commonly used scale of magnitude and the aftershock measured 4.6 .",

            "SAN FRANCISCO _ Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific journal in 1997 .",
            "It might have been just a lucky guess .",
            "Still , if it was a guess , it was a remarkably good one .",
            "In the scientific article , two U.S. Geological Survey researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a small possibility of `` a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit , '' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault , within the next 30 years .",
            "Early Tuesday morning , a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles south of Izmit .",
            "Early indications are that the epicenter was on the Sapanca Fault , which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault system .",
            "The article , published in Geophysical Research International and titled `` Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since 1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering , '' was written by veteran USGS researchers Ross S. Stein and James H. Dieterich and Aykut A. Barka of the department of geology at Istanbul Technical University .",
            "`` The earthquake occurred right in this area that we described , '' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday .",
            "`` This earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper . ''",
            "At the same time , he said , `` I 'm a little bit reluctant to claim that we forecast the earthquake , '' mainly because they assigned only a 12 percent probability to it .",
            "Stein , Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes .",
            "Since 1939 , 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with each occurrence , `` like falling dominoes , '' as the scientists described it .",
            "The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat , domino-style pattern of occurrence .",
            "According to geological theory , a quake changes crustal stress in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in that region .",
            "According to the calculations by the scientists , a 1967 quake immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region .",
            "In the paper , they forecast that the increased stress could eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault .",
            "On this basis , the three scientists proposed in their article that over the next 30 years , there was a 12 percent probability for a large event south of Izmit , which lies farther west than the 1967 quake .",
            "They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan .",
            "The Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake .",
            "Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky guess , it reinforces Dieterich 's confidence in an emerging paradigm of earthquake science : the importance of crustal stress changes in triggering or inhibiting future quakes .",
            "In recent years , quake specialists have developed computer models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth 's crust .",

            "The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake of 1906 , USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said .",
            "`` The 1906 earthquake was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault in the Bay Area , '' Simpson said Wednesday .",

            "IZMIT , Turkey _ From the streets to government offices , earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead and 35,000 missing from Tuesday 's disaster to the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless , many at risk of disease .",
            "`` They are overwhelmed and now they are completely concerned with the total number of dead , '' said Richard Van Hazebrouck , a UN humanitarian aid coordinator .",
            "`` They are not thinking of the next step , but we are putting pressure to get some figures of what the Turkish authorities need for the survivors , '' he said .",
            "Cargo planes from all over the world have brought in medical supplies , blankets , plastic sheeting and even field hospitals to help the living after Tuesday 's 7.4 magnitude quake , which authorities say could be the world 's deadliest in nearly a decade .",
            "But international relief workers are worried that this is not enough to care for the hundreds of thousands of people who will never be able to go home .",
            "`` We do n't need any more rescue teams on site .",
            "Now we must move into the second stage , which is looking after the survivors , '' said Hazebrouck .",
            "With water pipes broken and electric lines down over a huge swath of Turkey 's northeast , relief workers are also concerned about the possible spread of disease , especially with the thousands of corpses rotting under the rubble .",
            "An epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta flew into Turkey Friday to help assess health needs , along with two US water sanitation experts .",
            "`` You want to be sure , especially with this sweltering weather , that you 're not looking at an outbreak of contagious diseases , '' said Hugh Parmer , assistant administrator of the US Agency for International Development 's humanitarian relief department .",
            "Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit , dressed in black , echoed Parmer 's concern .",
            "`` Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of epidemic , '' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara .",
            "Foreign engineers and architects are expected to arrive in Turkey over the next few days to help officials decide which buildings must be knocked down because of heavy damage and which can remain standing .",
            "Many still-standing buildings in the hard-hit Izmit and Yalova areas are clearly unsafe , lurching down at one end or leaning dangerously out into the street .",
            "Five aftershocks , ranging between 4.3 and 4.6 on the Richter scale , rocked the disaster zone Friday .",
            "For now , many people are living out in the open , along the side of roads and in parks in the city center .",
            "Families string up sheets and blankets for privacy , the few possessions they managed to save carefully arranged in the only place they can now call home .",
            "`` People must understand that there is an urgent need for portable toilets , cleaning materials , garbage collection - the local authorities are not able to cope with the scale of these things , '' said Karen Lever , an International Red Cross logistical worker in the makeshift tent hospital located in Yalova 's football stadium .",
            "She spoke outside a tent in which staffers were preparing for an expected upsurge of infectious diseases .",
            "`` The water will be a problem _ clean water .",
            "And sewage and disposing of bodies with all these people outside in ( 95-degree ) heat . ''",
            "Her voice trailed off .",
            "But for many of those who did manage to get out alive after the 45-second quake that destroyed so much , the only issue was whether more people could be pulled from the wreckage .",
            "For four days , large swaths of Izmit were forbidden to rescue workers while firefighters battled a blaze at the nation 's biggest petroleum refinery .",
            "The ruins of the shattered houses there now conceal an unknown number of dead , and , perhaps , injured .",
            "Foreign search and rescue teams managed to find at least three people Friday , raising hopes that others may have survived underneath the collapsed buildings , despite the heat and the lack of water .",
            "A 70-member American team that arrived on Wednesday in Izmit has been scouring the crumbled building remains one by one , with German Shepherds trained to sniff any smell of life .",
            "Saturday another team of about 90 people will arrive .",
            "But on the wreckage of what was once a six-story apartment building , the yellow-helmeted rescue workers could do little for the relatives of a young woman and her father , whose weak shouts had been heard until about mid afternoon .",

            "shouted the aid team 's Turkish translator , kneeling over a small hole between two huge slabs of concrete .",
            "`` With whatever strength you still have scream , please scream , scream ! ''",
            "she cried , while a sensitive microphone was dangled into the hole .",

            "`` This machine will pick up anything , heartbeats , breathing , and there 's no real indication that there 's anything down there _ we 're not going to stay here , '' Daniel Bickham announced to the crowd .",
            "But the pleas of a young Turkish soldier _ who had heard some sounds just a few hours earlier _ convinced the team to give it one more try .",
            "Two hours later , the rescue workers finally walked away , leaving behind the anguished cries of onlookers and what rescue workers were certain were two corpses buried in the rubble .",
            "It was the same scene on Yalova 's Stadium Street , now devoid of the apartment buildings where hundreds of families had lived before 3:04 a.m. Tuesday .",
            "For 10 minues , French rescue workers and Turkish volunteers stopped working to huddle together in total silence , straining to hear anything from their delicate microphones .",
            "After a few minutes , they stood back from the rubble , their heads shaking .",
            "On one street in Izmit , not even the rumble of bulldozers ripping through concrete and crushed furniture could convince 26-year-old Ilkay Yildiz that his 20-year-old fiance with the long brown hair and quick smile was dead .",
            "Every day since the quake he has been waiting at the edge of the rubble for Hacer Subasi to appear .",
            "Even after the foreign rescue team left a day earlier _ convinced that there was nobody left to save _ and the bulldozer started digging for corpses , Yildiz refuses to move .",
