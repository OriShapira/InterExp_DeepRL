                "But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s , organic food came to account for $ 1 of every $ 100 spent on food , and in 1997 the agency took notice , proposing national organic standards for all food .",
                "USDA first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the organic industry strongly objected to provisions that could have allowed the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer , as well as genetically engineered and irradiated ingredients .",
                "WASHINGTON _ More than two years after the federal government 's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval , the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label .",
                "Those standards require third-party certification that the meat and poultry are raised on organic feed , without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones , that they have access to the outside and that there is a manure management plan .",
                "The new standards , intended to replace a hodgepodge of state and private rules , also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in livestock production and require the use of organic feed .",
                "The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that , even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country , the conventional food industry is worried .",
                "The new rules indicate an about-face in the department 's attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for decades .",
                "There have been virtually no corn exports from the United States because the genetically modified corn can not be separated from the rest of the crop , costing American farmers about $ 200 million a year .",
                "Fifty-four percent said in January they were very or somewhat likely to buy produce that was modified to taste better or stay fresh longer , compared with 58 percent in 1996 ."
