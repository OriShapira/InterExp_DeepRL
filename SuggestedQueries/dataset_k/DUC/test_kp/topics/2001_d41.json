            "And , after a sweeping review and nationwide public hearings , the agency has tentatively decided to modify -- though not flatly abandon -- the controversial fire strategy once the moratorium expires .",
            "Under the changes , expected to be announced shortly by Bush Administration officials , all parks would have to run through a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather , moisture , winds and available firefighting crews before they could make a decision on whether or not to let a lightning fire burn .",
            "Leading environmentalists are cautiously optimistic about the new plan because it retains at least a stated commitment to the retention of so-called `` natural '' policies .",
            "At the same time , however , they warn that saddling park managers with extensive conditions could effectively result in quick suppression of all wildfires .",
            "May Become Gun-Shy Michael Scott , regional director of the Wilderness Society , said restrictions could lead to a `` systematic politicization of ecosystem management '' and make officials gun-shy about letting fire burn for any reason .",

            "`` There could be a chilling effect on allowing nature to take its course . ''",
            "From an ecologist 's standpoint , the `` let-burn '' policy could be the most serious casualty of last year 's blazes , which swelled to historic proportions and ultimately seared nearly 1 million of the park 's 2.2 million acres .",
            "Heeding complaints that fires were getting out of hand and could threaten surrounding communities , officials suspended the policy by mid-July .",
            "And some of last year 's most destructive blazes were triggered by man , not nature , and fought from the first sign of smoke .",
            "Eventually 25,000 firefighters were called in from around the nation and the bill for suppression efforts soared to $ 120 million , nearly 10 times the size of Yellowstone 's annual operating budget .",
            "Authorities say the flames were fanned by record drought and gale- force winds and virtually nothing could have stopped them .",

            "They say the park did too little , too late and let the fires get out of hand .",

            "The Johns Hopkins tests , conducted on 52 Northern California wildland firefighters during the 1988 season , showed that their lung function -- or flow of oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3 % even eight weeks after exposure .",
            "The researchers said they have not determined if the lungs heal between seasons or if the damage accumulates .",

            "Sommers said no other federal agency devotes that little , especially when jobs are life-threatening .",
            "Other hazard-prone occupational groups , such as chemical workers and construction crews , are much better protected , he said .",

            "Ford recalled that some of the officers wore gas masks , yet the firefighters wore only bandannas .",
            "The crews slept in makeshift tents -- cotton sheets strung over clotheslines .",
            "Because the camp offered no respite from the smoke , the firefighters breathed it 24 hours a day for several weeks .",
            "Ford questioned the firefighters about their health and was shocked by how many had alarming symptoms .",
            "He listened to their chests , and heard wheezing in almost every one .",
            "Candace Gregory , 33 , the first woman battalion chief at the California Department of Forestry , recalls that 11 members on her crew of 15 fell ill. `` You were literally living in the smoke .",
