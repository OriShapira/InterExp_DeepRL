            "In presentations to Botswana 's Minerals Policy Committee and members of parliament , IDC has been arguing that , not only was it commercially essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output , but that the country had a political responsibility to do so .",

            "'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale of its diamonds . '",

            "It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO 's efforts to keep the diamond market stable .",

            "It suggests IDC 's arguments are flawed because they are based on an assumption that Botswana needs more market information .",
            "However , in common with other producers selling diamonds to the CSO , Botswana has appointed independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the prices paid .",

            "But now De Beers is steering the world 's most successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the recession in the US ( the biggest single market for diamonds ) , sogginess in Japan ( the second-largest ) , and the Gulf war .",

            "Mr Simon Webb , the general manager , says that the underground development has given it another 35 to 40 years of life .",
            "All this goes to show that De Beers , the South African group that dominates world trade in rough ( uncut ) diamonds , still has complete faith in its ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with Russia .",
            "It also remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its 100-year-old mines at Kimberley are now running down .",

            "Our costs compare with the best in the group . '",
            "Among the innovations that have helped Finsch achieve its objectives are some remote-controlled LHD ( load-haul-dump ) trucks which are similar to radio-controlled toy vehicles or boats .",
            "Using VHF radio signals , a driver can stand back and send a truck on its own to dig out material from areas between the old pit wall and the underground development that would not otherwise be mined because of the dangers involved .",
            "When , as occasionally happens , rock crashes on to the LHD trucks , it is relatively simply to haul the vehicles out virtually undamaged .",
            "Mr Webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres , at which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make recovery viable .",
            "Finsch - named after the discoverers , Messrs Fincham and Schwabel , who stumbled across the kimberlite pipe containing the diamonds when actually they were looking for asbestos - is one of the victims of the present turmoil in the diamond market caused mainly by uncertainties about Russian exports .",

            "Venetia 's success is strategically important to De Beers because , when its output is added to that in Botswana and Namibia , it gives the group direct control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output .",
            "This provides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerful position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel .",
            "And , while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life , it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues , at least as far as South Africa is concerned .",
            "For example , there are no migrant workers at the mine .",
            "Employees are bussed in from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families .",
