            "The joint investigation headquarters ' announcement on Dec. 24 , 1979 , charging Chong with high treason was based not on any concrete evidence but on what he did after after Kim killed Pak on the night of Oct. 26 , 1979 , Paek was quoted as saying .",

            "The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong Kyong-sik , a member of the joint team , called on the martial law commander at his office three times to question him about his actions on the assassination day , Paek was quoted as saying .",
            "Paek said that without evidence supporting his involvement in the assassination and without then President Choe Kyu-ha 's permission , the joint military-prosecution investigation headquarters , led by then Defense Security Commander Maj. Gen. Chon Tu-hwan forcibly arrested Chong , seemingly because of the headquarters ' `` political motive , '' suggesting that the Dec. 12 incident was a mutiny by the `` new military elite '' to topple the government .",
            "The prosecution is considering summoning lawyer Won Kang-hui , who as military prosecutor indicted Chong Sung-hwa on charges of abetting high treason , for questioning .",
            "Won recently said there was no criminal evidence against Chong when he indicted him , adding the military prosecution then made `` a different evaluation '' of his actions on the assassination day .",
