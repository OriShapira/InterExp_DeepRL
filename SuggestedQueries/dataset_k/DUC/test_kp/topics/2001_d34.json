            "A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas , but says it 's impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas .",
            "William Gray , a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University , said Friday he expects about six Atlantic hurricanes this year , the average for the last 40 years , but above average for the decade .",
            "The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons .",
            "Those years brought just two to five hurricanes each , except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985 .",
            "The hurricane season officially begins June 1 , and its most active period usually begins Aug. 1 .",
            "Gray , who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual hurricane forecasts each year since 1984 , will issue his first formal 1988 forecast in late May .",
            "He issued an early `` outlook '' Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference .",
            "`` It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years , except for the 1985 season , '' Gray said in a paper presented to the conference .",
            "But Gray said his models of air pressure , winds around the equator and winds for `` El Nino '' periods , when eastern Pacific waters are warmer than usual , do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form .",
            "Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterly winds at the equator and the approaching end of `` El Nino '' period .",
            "Gray predicted four hurricanes last season , and three actually occurred .",
            "His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money , and he originally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure to seven , the eventual correct number , in 1985 .",
            "In 1984 , when there were five hurricanes , Gray had predicted seven .",
            "Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s , Gray said .",
            "He said the drought has robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start their escalation into hurricanes .",
            "That pattern eventually will change , he said , `` but it is impossible to say when this shift will occur . ''",
            "Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference stressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the lull in hurricanes ; a surge in storms , up to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s , could bring unprecedented damage , they said ."

            "A study has found that the U.S. death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted , the head of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday to mark the opening of the 1988 Atlantic storm season .",
            "Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier thought must be evacuated under certain conditions , said center director Bob Sheets .",
            "Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties from Maine to Texas , and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier islands is virtually impossible , Sheets said .",
            "There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and there are serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations , he said .",
            "During a hurricane that struck Houston , `` glass was flying everywhere , '' said Sheets .",
            "He refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season , saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predict the number and severity of storms .",
            "The first tropical depression of the year has formed , and remained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip of Cuba , or about 200 miles southwest of Havana .",

            "One of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes could fail this year , forecasters said .",
            "`` It 's quite possible this year that we could lose GOES-West at anytime , '' hurricane specialist Bob Case said of the Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite , which records atmospheric conditions over the Pacific Ocean and part of the Western Hemisphere .",
            "If that satellite does stop working , GOES-East would have to be directed to move from its equatorial orbit over Brazil to a spot south of the Texas Gulf Coast , where it would provide a view of the Western Hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricane-spawning eastern Atlantic , he said .",
            "A previous GOES-East expired in 1984 and temporarily deprived meteorologists of Atlantic atmospheric photographs .",
            "A typical Atlantic hurricane season , from June 1 to Nov. 30 , has 10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind exceeding 39 mph , six of which become hurricanes with drenching rain and wind over 74 mph , Case said .",
            "In 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the Atlantic .",
            "Hurricane Emily slammed into the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22 , causing three deaths with wind gusts up to 110 mph .",

            "Mr. Gray said his research , published in the current issue of Science , suggests that `` intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert , Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change . ''",
            "Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes , Mr. Gray found a striking correlation .",
            "From 1947 to 1969 , for instance , rainfall in the western Sahel was especially abundant , and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean .",
            "From 1970 to 1988 , the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought , and hurricane activity was unusually low ; only one severe hurricane , Gloria in 1985 , formed in the area .",

            "He found that the Sahel was especially wet from 1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935 .",
