            "The group contends that including the estimated 2 million or more illegal aliens in the national head count , which is used to distribute seats in the House of Representatives , will cause unfair shifts of seats from one state to another .",
            "Census officials say they are required to count everyone by the U.S. Constitution , which does not mention citizenship but only instructs that the House apportionment be based on the `` whole number of persons '' residing in the various states .",
