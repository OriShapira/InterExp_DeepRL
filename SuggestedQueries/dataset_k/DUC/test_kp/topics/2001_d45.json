            "The announcement about the normalization of relations were also supported by information that an official Slovene delegation had arrived in Belgrade for this purpose , but it was stated that the details can not yet be published since the matter is very delicate .",
            "The FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs is denying that any official Slovene delegation came to Belgrade .",

            "The UN embargo on trade with Serbia means both the loss of the largest of the former Yugoslav markets and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials and other inputs .",
            "These helped restrain costs and improve competitiveness in more demanding hard currency markets .",
            "Now Slovenia has to lower real wages and increase productivity in order to compensate .",

            "Relations with Croatia , Slovenia 's southern neighbour , are generally good but they are complicated by three contentious issues .",

            "There is no nostalgia for the old Yugoslavia , which Slovenes tried without success to trans- form into a looser confederal structure .",
            "But a mixture of compassion for the suffering of their fellow southern Slavs and economic loss ensures that the Slovene authorities , while categorically ruling out any possibility of resuming old political ties with former Yugoslavia , pray , without much hope , for a quick and lasting solution to the conflict and the resumption of normal economic ties .",
            "The war , with its violent and deliberate displacement of millions of people , has and is taking place in the ethnically mixed border lands of Croatia and Bosnia relatively distant from the Slovene border .",

            "Meanwhile , the coalition government which emerged from last December 's elections to the national parliament and parallel presidential elections , is determined to use its four-year mandate to complete the transformation of the country into a fully-fledged , market-orientated , multi-party parliamentary democracy .",
            "At the core of the government is an alliance between the Liberal Democrats , headed by Mr Drnovsek , which emerged as the largest single party with 25 per cent of seats in parliament , and the Christian Democrats led by Mr Lojze Peterle , the foreign minister .",
            "But the coalition also includes the four party 'associated list ' , made up principally of reformed communists .",

            "The next four years will be crucial .",
            "But much has been achieved in the first 20 months of independence - including the establishment of a parliamentary democracy and a virtually convertible independent currency , the Slovene tolar , backed by strong reserves .",
            "The new republic is peaceful , internationally recognised and a member of the most important inter- national institutions .",
            "By the end of the century it wants to be eligible for full membership of an enlarged European Community .",
            "As elsewhere in the region , privatisation and other structural reforms are seen as laying the basis for the development of a self-confident middle class capable of ensuring that the democratic and economic reforms under way in Slovenia become irreversible ."
