            "They noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much of North America in 1988 , meteorologists often reply `` the jet stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms , which tend to track along the path of the jet stream , were similarly displaced northward .

            "`` Such an answer is , however , just a brief description of the weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the cause .",

            "Their proposed answer focuses on the development in April , May and June of drought in the Midwest , where several states recorded less rain than at any time since 1895 .",
            "By July the weather pattern they studied was breaking up , and continuing dryness in the study area and elsewhere probably had other causes , Arkin said .",
            "But during the April-June period there were alternating high and low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the Western Hemisphere : A high-pressure center north of Hawaii , a low in the Gulf of Alaska , a high in central Canada extending down into the northern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast .",
            "In this period , Pacific Ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of South America , with the coolest spot midway along the band .",
            "At the same time , a bit to the north of this band , surface temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal .",
            "When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer , the pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was reproduced .",
            "The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did not give such a result .",
            "`` We have n't proved anything ; all we 've done is shown that it 's a possibility , '' Arkin said .",
            "The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought , he said .",
            "If the model holds up , the work will be the first demonstration of tropical sea surface temperatures affecting weather outside the tropics in the summer , Arkin said .",

            "`` Clearly , we will have to appraise very carefully the desirability of using export enhancement funds at a time when ( U.S. ) supplies are unpredictable , '' Mr. Yeutter said .",
            "Shrinking soybean stockpiles and soaring prices have stirred speculation that the government may impose an embargo on exports of soybeans and soybean products .",
            "Growers still complain about the 1973 embargo , which they say hurt the nation 's reputation as a reliable supplier .",
            "But Mr. Yeutter said he would `` vigorously '' oppose any embargo on U.S. soybean exports .",
            "Earlier this week , Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng took an equally adamant stand against such an embargo .",
            "Before the drought began damaging crops this month , the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers .",

            "Tractor sales by farm equipment dealers were up 12.8 % during the first five months of the year .",
            "Now , with farmers in many Midwest states expecting smaller harvests this year , these businesses are seeing their new-found trade evaporating .",
            "`` Everybody is watching the dollars they have , '' says Allen Olson , a vice president of the National Bank of Harvey , N.D. , where the drought has already halved the potential yield of the local wheat crop .",

            "Few in farming expect the drought to trigger an agricultural recession , although more farmers could go bankrupt because of it .",
            "But all bets are off on how farmers will fare at the end of this year 's harvests .",
            "While crop prices are soaring on weather-worries , yields may be so low in many areas that farmers wo n't do nearly as well as expected .",
            "If farmers are strapped for cash this year , the effects would ripple throughout the farm economy .",
            "Bob Pfiefer , owner of a Massey-Ferguson farm equipment dealership in Sioux Falls , S.D. , says he has already canceled some orders for fear that sales will soon begin dropping off .",

            "In Franklin , Tenn. , implement dealer Larry Holt is slashing his fall orders by one-third , even though sales so far this year are up roughly 25 % .",

            "J.I .",
            "Case , the farm implement-making unit of Tenneco Inc. , is considering cutting production schedules if the drought continues through July .",
            "`` It 's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought , '' says James K. Ashford , Case president and chief executive officer .",
            "He said that if the drought continues , industrywide tractor sales could turn flat next year instead of climbing the 5 % to 6 % that was originally forecast for 1989 .",
            "Among rural banks , loan problems are expected to rise and profits to fall .",
            "`` Before the drought we expected a very solid year '' for farm lenders , says Mark Drabenstott , an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank .",
            "`` There are a lot of question marks right now . ''",
            "Many rural lenders this spring were banking on farmers losing some of their post-farm crisis inhibitions about going into hock .",
            "One of the biggest problems for farm banks has been that their number of loans , a major source of bank income , has shriveled as farmers paid off their debts with last year 's profits .",
            "In Anadarko , Okla. , bankers worry now that ranchers are going to make less money this year because crop damage is escalating the cost of feeding cattle .",
            "`` The drought is going to hurt us because it hurts the cattle market , '' says Lance Shenold , a vice president of Anadarko Bank & Trust Co .",
            "The land boom is wilting .",
            "Because of the drought , Iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5 % to 10 % they had been expecting .",
            "`` Everybody has just kind of pulled in their horns , '' says Jim Frevert , vice president of Hertz Farm Management Inc. , Nevada , Iowa .",
            "A big drop in harvests this year could squeeze investors who had planned on good yields to help pay their real estate loans .",
            "Most of the farmers who have bought land recently did so for cash , but many of the urban investors got in on credit , real estate agents say .",
            "Among all the uncertainty , however , some are looking for a silver lining .",
            "`` I will be hurt a bit , '' says Mark Dadd , an economist who is buying a 420-acre farm in Missouri .",
            "`` But I regard this as a distinctly positive thing . ''",
            "He is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity .",
            "`` I 'm here for the capital gain over the long haul , '' he says .",
            "The drought is also fanning wildly different predictions of how the farm economy will turn next year .",
            "Some economists think high crop prices will spark more planting , which would benefit agribusiness , while others think farmers will start the next growing season more conservative .",
            "Paul Prentice of Farm Sector Economics Associates , a forecasting concern , thinks the drought could so deplete U.S. stockpiles that the Agriculture Department would drop much of its farm crisis-era planting restrictions .",
            "He is projecting that the number of acres planted with corn could rise by about one-fifth and soybean acreage could increase by one-sixth .",
            "Others , however , see little chance that recession-weary farmers would be willing to take the risk of planting fence-row to fence-row like they did a decade ago .",
            "`` I do n't see us getting on a late '70s bandwagon , '' says Mr. Drabenstott of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank .",
            "`` Both borrowers and lenders have developed pretty good memories . ''",
            "The decision by Mr. Lyng , the secretary of agriculture , to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on Conservation Reserve Program land came as farmers and ranchers in North Dakota , Minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops .",
            "Nationwide , pasture conditions on June 1 were the worst they have been since 1934 , according to the Agriculture Department .",
            "Mr. Lyng 's order covers counties where livestock-grazing and hay-mowing on so-called set-aside acres already has been authorized , and the drought 's effects have been rated as `` severe . ''",
            "Every county in North Dakota meets these criteria .",
            "The department said it wo n't allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program , under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production ."
