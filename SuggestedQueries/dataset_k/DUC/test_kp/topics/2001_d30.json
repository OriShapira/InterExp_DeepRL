            "Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreau Sodre of Brazil told the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly that the Third World economic picture was dimming `` due to the lack of progress in international economic relations . ''",
            "`` It is ... sad to note that we , American , Asian , African brothers , still suffer from the same horrors and the same desolation which so badly affected our forebears , '' he said , adding , `` hunger ... is endemically spreading throughout the continents . ''",

            "Brazil , with $ 121 billion in foreign loans , has been among the strongest Third World lobbyists for debt restructuring and writeoffs .",
            "It signed a comprehensive rescheduling agrement last week with its Western creditors .",

            "How can 6,000 civil servants , mostly based in Washington , best promote development in the Third World ?",
            "That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston , the former chairman of J P Morgan , the New York bank , who takes over as president of the World Bank this September .",
            "As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund , there was no shortage of advice .",
            "The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector .",

            "Mr Preston may relax on one count .",
            "Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed : new imperatives , such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East , have merely been superimposed on older , unsolved problems : Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world : 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day .",

            "'The morale of staff is lousy , ' says Mr Charles Flickner , a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank .",
            "Mr Conable , a former Republican congressman , arrived at the bank in 1986 knowing little about either banking or development .",
            "Although now well-liked ( partly for championing causes such as women 's rights in the Third World ) , many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank .",
            "Mr Percy Mistry , a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House , Oxford , and former senior adviser at the bank , says it suffered from 'presidential failure ' during the 1980s .",
            "Mr Robert McNamara , a forceful chief executive in the 1970s , built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership from the top .",
            "But neither Mr Conable nor his predecessor , Mr A W 'Tom ' Clausen , a commercial banker , could fill his shoes .",
            "For a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents : Mr Ernest Stern ( who nearly left last year to join the EBRD ) and Mr Moeen Qureshi .",
            "Mr Preston 's first challenge , says Mr Mistry , will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi ; his second , to prune legions of 'useless advisers ' and install managers with real-world experience .",
            "His third , one might add , will be quickly to establish his independence from the US Treasury which always browbeats a newcomer .",
            "What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit ?",
            "In spite of recent progress in a few countries , such as Mexico , the past decade has been one of relative failure .",
            "Many Third World countries have gone backwards .",
            "Real per capita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East , and mildly in Latin America .",
            "The biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and early 1980s .",
            "Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr Nicholas Brady , the US Treasury Secretary , in 1989 , as a 'final solution ' to the debt crisis .",
            "Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden of developing countries ' private debts on condition that they implement market-oriented economic reforms .",
            "'The Brady plan is enough , ' says Mr Williamson , if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt .",
            "Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of Poland 's official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors .",
            "Mr Williamson laughs .",
            "'In the long run it will be impossible to isolate Poland , ' he says .",
            "'It is not so much more deserving than other countries . '",
            "But why was a Brady-type solution not launched much earlier ?",
            "For most of the 1980s , the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness .",
            "The result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some Dollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980 .",
            "'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis , ' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg , director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington .",
            "( The IMF was equally short-sighted . )",
            "As incoming president , Mr Preston must review the bank 's strategies for promoting development .",
            "The main innovation of the 1980s was a switch from project lending to 'structural adjustment ' lending .",
            "Making finance conditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic performance of developing countries .",
            "But studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive .",
            "This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank 's policies were sometimes misguided .",
            "Professor John Toye , director of the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University , recently completed an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes .",
            "He concludes ( as do internal bank analyses ) that policy-based lending has 'achieved something , particularly in relation to the external account , but not nearly as much as the bank and donor community hoped ' .",
            "On average programmes have reduced balance of payments gaps , had a negligible impact on Gross National Product and led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP .",
            "Mr Feinberg calls the decline in investment the 'great shortcoming of structural adjustment lending in the 1980s ' .",
            "( Investment to GNP ratios have fallen markedly in Africa , the Middle East and Latin America . )",
            "He says the bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of adjustment by increasing investment .",
            "How can the bank do better in the 1990s ?",
            "One problem is that it has lost leverage over many Third World governments .",
            "The maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries .",
            "According to Mr Lawrence Summers , the bank 's chief economist , net transfers over the next five years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with Dollars 9 ( in current prices ) in the late 1970s .",
            "For the large number of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans , the net flow will be negative .",
            "Some analysts , including US Treasury officials , believe lacklustre performance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency ( and sometimes corruption ) of governments .",
            "The EBRD 's constitution requires borrowers to be 'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy , pluralism and market economics ' .",
            "It also says 60 per cent of EBRD resources must be devoted to the commercial sector - private businesses and state concerns in the process of privatisation .",
            "The World Bank operates under very different rules : its charter requires it to be non-political and only its small affiliate , the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) , can make direct loans to private businesses .",
            "Should the bank 's charter be amended ?",
            "Direct parallels between the bank and the EBRD are dubious .",
            "The EBRD is ministering to a region that has historical ties with western Europe and that has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets .",
            "Such values are alien in many developing countries , but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development .",
            "If strict political conditionality had been imposed in the past , the bank could not have lent to a development star such as South Korea .",
            "Most analysts , however , say the bank should tighten up a little .",
            "Mr Flickner of the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist on Westminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that 'loans will benefit the majority of the people ' .",
            "Bank officials say greater attention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of decision-taking .",
            "Should a significant chunk of the bank 's loans be made direct to the private sector ?",
            "Mr Conable , to his credit , is resisting the US Treasury 's pressure .",
            "He says the bank 's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market ' in developing countries .",
            "In reality , much of the most badly-needed investment is in spheres such as infrastructure , health care and education where governments play a dominant role even in industrialised countries .",
            "Indeed , one conclusion of Prof Toye 's analysis is that policy-based loans would have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand the role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote economic liberalisation .",
            "Sir William Ryrie , the head of the IFC , says the objective of a large volume of public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed .",
            "'What we are trying to do is facilitate the flow of private-sector funds into sound investments . '",
            "Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs ; but if subsidies are ruled out , why should the bank 's judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west ?",
            "There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development .",
            "During the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums .",
            "It wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently fashionable in the industrialised world .",
            "But the notion that economic liberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned .",
            "The bank 's own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly and to improve fundamentals , such as education , nutrition and health care .",
            "'Liberalisation matters , ' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for International Economics , 'but education is more important . '",
            "He argues that the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to put resources into education and primary health care .",
            "Mr Feinberg at the Overseas Development Council broadly agrees : the bank has got to find a way of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development ' .",
            "The challenge for Mr Preston is clear : put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital .",
            "Mr Summers , the bank 's economist , says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade , the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas .",
            "Ideas are certainly important , but they do not build hospitals or schools .",
            "More money could be made available : a mere 10 per cent cut in western defence spending , for example , would pay for a doubling of official aid .",
            "Rather than tamely accepting the status quo , Mr Preston could use his platform to promote a more constructive attitude in rich countries .",

            "The figure , contained in the bank 's annual report and made public before its annual meeting here Sept. 23 , was almost a third larger than in 1987 , when the net pay-back totaled $ 38.3 billion .",
            "The cash drain has been growing steadily since 1984 , when it was $ 10.2 billion .",
            "The bank also reported that , despite the relatively buoyant economic growth in most industrial countries , developing countries turned in a decidedly mixed performance , ranging from a mini-boom in Southeast Asian economies to further impoverishment in Africa .",

            "Bank of Boston Corp. 's decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions , bankers and analysts say .",
            "Domestically , the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York , Chicago and San Francisco .",
            "Internationally , it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans .",
            "U.S. banks are increasingly splitting into two groups .",
            "On one hand , there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries .",
            "On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which , with relatively small exposure to developing countries , are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or , as Bank of Boston decided Monday , to completely write off some loans as uncollectible .",
            "`` It 's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out , '' says Lawrence Cohn , an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co .",
            "The Bank of Boston decision `` may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks , '' adds James J. McDermott , Jr. , director of research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. , a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks .",
            "`` It 's created an enormous quandary for many money-center banks , '' Mr. McDermott says .",
            "Actions such as that taken by Bank of Boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks .",
            "Management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks .",
            "The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities , bank analysts said .",
            "While the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston , they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations .",
            "Earlier this year , Bank of Boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a $ 6 billion bank loan for Mexico , according to New York bankers .",
            "Now that Bank of Boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries , it 's likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts .",
            "That could add to the lending burden for the biggest U.S. banks .",
            "Moreover , most of the nation 's big banks could n't afford to follow Bank of Boston 's lead without crippling their capital , and reducing their common equity-asset ratios to unacceptably low levels .",
            "For instance , if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston 's action , it would have to add $ 3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69 % , Keefe Bruyette estimates .",
            "In order to take steps similar to Bank of Boston 's , large money-center banks would have to sell assets , shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that .",
            "Yesterday , Manufacturers Hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share , offering investors a yield of more than 13 % annually .",
            "Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston 's action .",
            "Other large New York banks also declined to disclose their plans , although a spokeman for Chase Manhattan Corp. , said , `` We 're obviously looking at it . ''",
            "Mellon Bank Corp. said yesterday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $ 220 million , and that it would increase loan-loss reserves by about $ 180 million to cover troubled foreign loans .",
            "The stocks of several major money-center banks fell sharply yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .",
            "Chase Manhattan skidded $ 2.25 to close at $ 20.125 , Manufacturers Hanover fell $ 2.375 to $ 24.25 , and J.P. Morgan & Co. was off $ 1.50 to $ 30 .",
            "Bank of Boston closed up 50 cents at $ 20.75 , while Mellon fell $ 1 to $ 26.25 .",
            "Analysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by Bank of Boston .",
            "`` I would n't be surprised if some of the medium-sized regionals decided to follow , '' said Cheryl Swaim , an analyst and vice president at Oppenheimer & Co .",
            "In Boston , there were rumors Bank of New England might announce a similar move , but a company spokesman said `` reserve levels are appropriate . ''",
            "Bank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $ 200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis .",
            "When a loan is placed on non-accrual , a bank only credits interest it actually receives , and does n't automatically accrue interest due .",
            "Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $ 470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade .",
            "Along with $ 330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual , Bank of Boston has now either charged off , or put on non-accrual , all of its $ 1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries .",
            "This does n't include $ 170 million in trade-related debt .",
            "While Bank of Boston 's action is the most striking to date to remove Latin exposure from its balance sheet , smaller similar actions began at other banks around mid-year .",
            "First Bank System Inc. , Minneapolis , the nation 's 15th biggest banking concern , charged off $ 25.4 million in troubled foreign loans during the third quarter .",
            "First Chicago Corp. , the 11th largest banking concern , charged off $ 48.9 million in Third World loans during the quarter .",
            "And even before the big reserves were set aside , banks were quietly charging off Latin debt , though on a smaller scale .",
            "Last March , Continental Illinois Corp. said it had charged off about half of its $ 100 million of loans to Peru .",
            "Continental would n't comment yesterday on Bank of Boston 's action .",

            "World Bank President Barber Conable was so well regarded during his 20-year career as a Republican congressman from New York that some journalists nicknamed him `` H.R . ''",
            "-- for `` highly respected . ''",
            "And to many on Capitol Hill , Mr. Conable still is .",
            "Rep. Tom Foley , a liberal Democrat from Washington State , calls him `` a very strong asset '' to the 151-nation institution `` because of the enormous respect he has on both sides of the aisle . ''",
            "But at the World Bank , Mr. Conable finds himself under fire .",
            "After a year and a half in office , he has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem .",
            "`` The World Bank has been reluctant to step out on this issue in confrontation and conflict with the Treasury , '' charges Sen. Bill Bradley , a New Jersey Democrat and Congress 's leading voice on the debt problem .",
            "Rep. John LaFalce , a New York Democrat and another leader on the issue , agrees .",
            "`` There surely is a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem than it has played so far , but they just ca n't get out ahead of the administration , '' he says .",
            "While the debt morass has deepened , Mr. Conable 's World Bank has looked inward , shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a $ 74.8 billion increase in its capital .",
            "As Congress considers the increase , liberal critics on Capitol Hill are demanding that Mr. Conable show he is ready to use the bank 's vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of Third World debt .",
            "House Democrats , in fact , cut out of the foreign-aid bill passed last month all $ 70 million the administration had sought for the first year of the U.S. share of the increase in capital .",
            "The deletion was made pending action by a committee looking into the bank 's approach to the debt crisis .",
            "So far , Mr. Conable has approached the debt crisis more like a cautious financier than a bold politician .",
            "He has clung to the bank 's traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked him for his job -- U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker .",
            "Mr. Conable subscribes to the `` Baker Plan , '' which stresses new lending by commercial banks and the World Bank to debtor countries that adopt growth-oriented , market-based economic reforms .",
            "The bank has tried to help the countries by tiding them over with some new loans .",
            "That policy contrasts sharply with some of the more aggressive debt-reduction plans .",
            "Sen. Bradley , worried that the debt burden stalls growth and threatens political stability in developing countries , proposes that Third World debtors be required to make certain economic reforms ; in return , their lending banks would forgive some of the loans and write them down on their books .",
            "Even the World Bank 's longtime financial wizard , Eugene Rotberg -- who quit the bank for Merrill Lynch over Mr. Conable 's reorganization plan -- proposed last month that the World Bank guarantee new 20-year commercial-bank loans to Third World countries .",
            "Other experts advocate a `` debt facility '' to buy and refinance the debts .",
            "Defending his approach to the debt problem , Mr. Conable explains : `` We are n't a financial institution but a development institution .",
            "We ca n't go to our member countries and say , 'Give us a tremendous capital increase so we can assume the obligations of all these other creditors that a developing country owes . '",
            "Obviously , that would be viewed as our not performing a development function but our simply accepting other people 's risks . ''",
            "But critics reject that view .",
            "Jeffrey Sachs , a Harvard economist who has offered one of many debt-reduction plans , says the World Bank 's officials `` have the great potential to play a central role in the problem , but they 're basically ducking .",
            "There is a lack of intellectual leadership within the bank itself . ''",
            "Even some Reagan administration officials privately despair of Mr. Conable 's leadership and fear that it may have been a mistake to appoint him .",
            "While financial experts often urge the bank to do more , the ponderous institution has intervened only about half a dozen times in debt crises , usually just to guarantee a small portion of a commercial-bank loan package .",
            "Mr. Conable makes it clear that it wo n't do that often .",
            "Recently , commercial-bank lenders to Brazil tried to get the World Bank to insure a portion of a big new loan package they were negotiating .",
            "But the U.S. Treasury was firmly opposed to the idea , saying it was unnecessary in Brazil 's case and might foster the impression that such guarantees should be common .",
            "Secretary Baker says Mr. Conable is being criticized largely by legislators and academicians who favor grand debt-relief schemes that would `` take the debt and put it on the backs of the taxpayers .",
            "I 'll tell you who 'll pay for it : you and me when we file our 1040s .",
            "It 's a bad idea .",
            "They want Barber to subscribe to it , and I think that he sees that it 's a bad idea . ''",
            "Yet even inside the bank , there is increasing worry that the Third World debt -- totaling $ 1.19 trillion last year -- frustrates the bank 's goals .",
            "Because of `` chronic debt problems ... the development process in these countries has stalled , '' the World Bank said earlier this year .",
            "Also within the bank 's own ranks , there is talk that could lead to a more aggressive role on debt once President Reagan leaves office .",

            "`` Perhaps we have excessively underplayed our own role . ''",
            "He adds , `` It seems to me it will be desirable , in the present environment , to see what can be done '' to reduce debt , rather than just lend new money .",
            "Partly in response to the external and internal pressures , Mr. Conable sent a debt study to his board early in April .",
            "`` The likelihood is that the bank will need to play a more extensive and diversified role in two areas : new money packages and facilitating other forms of financial relief , including debt-reduction schemes , '' declares the study , which was drafted by David Bock , a vice president and the bank 's debt expert .",
            "The document even says that for a few debtors , `` consensual debt relief , '' including `` outright forgiveness , '' might be the only workable solution , but it stresses that the bank must avoid moves that threaten the `` preservation of the bank 's prime standing in financial markets . ''",
            "The bank 's own annual world-debt report illustrates its determination to stick to a back-seat role on the issue .",
            "Published early this year , the report noted that the debtor countries ' position `` has stubbornly failed to improve , '' said `` imagination and resolve are needed , '' and emphasized that `` leadership will itself be crucially important . ''",
            "But conspicuously absent from the report , which discussed debt-relief proposals from Secretary Baker , Sen. Bradley and others , were any ideas from the bank itself .",
            "The World Bank 's ethos is decidedly traditional .",
            "Founded in 1944 , it has evolved into a well-paid bureaucracy of 6,000 working in 17 buildings a few blocks from the White House , ignored by tourists but a mandatory stop for finance ministers and bankers visiting Washington .",
            "The bank earns more than $ 1 billion annually , sports a top credit rating in securities markets and lent nearly $ 18 billion last year .",
            "The U.S. is its biggest shareholder and controls the president 's job .",
            "The idea of the bank was to finance a wide range of economically basic construction across the developing world : roads in Africa , power projects in Asia , schools in Latin America , irrigation in India .",
            "Under Robert McNamara , the bank began aiding efforts to alleviate rural poverty , control population growth and fight illiteracy .",
            "Under A.W .",
            "Clausen , his successor , it increased its loans to finance structural adjustments -- rather than specific development projects -- in Third World economies and also disbursed money more quickly .",
            "Under Mr. Conable , a low-key , thoughtful man with a self-deprecating sense of humor , new policies have been harder to discern .",
            "He has continued to increase the quick-disbursing , non-project loans but has n't introduced any new type of lending .",
            "He also has set a goal for alleviating poverty in Asia and has won new financing to help the poor countries of Africa .",
            "But his main achievements have been bureaucratic .",
            "He set up staffs to handle environmental and women 's issues .",
            "One of these is the `` Safe Motherhood Initiative , '' a project designed to lower the high rate of deaths during childbirth , especially in Africa .",
            "Funds will be increased for related health and nutrition programs .",
            "Mr. Conable spent roughly a year reorganizing the bank so that project experts and country experts would work more closely .",
            "The new organization is more in tune with current Third World problems , but the change paralyzed the bank for months and delayed loan processing .",
            "Mr. Conable contends that the reorganization `` has helped a great deal in recapturing the support of our member countries , '' which had refused to approve the bank 's budget just before he took office .",
            "`` We have had a pretty good year , '' he says .",
            "`` We had a 100 % support of our budget ... and we are well on the way toward a substantial general capital increase . ''",
            "And , he adds , `` I have changed a lot of emphasis in our programs . ''",
            "Traditionally , conservatives have criticized the bank , charging that its policies promote central planning and thus discourages market forces .",
            "But the debt crisis is causing liberals to question Mr. Conable 's leadership from a different direction .",
            "`` Who is calling the shots on debt policy in the administration ?",
            "The Treasury .",
            "And who was responsible for appointing Conable ?",
            "The Treasury , '' Sen. Bradley contends .",
            "`` They appointed somebody that they knew they could control .",
            "Maybe Conable genuinely agrees with Baker , in which case he should be lumped in with Baker for criticism .",
            "If he disagrees , maybe we 'll see some new ideas at the World Bank . ''",
            "Mr. Conable insists that even though he backs the Baker debt strategy , he and the Treasury secretary `` have had strategic disagreements . ''",
            "Bank staffers cite a loan to Chile last year over U.S. opposition .",
            "The bank has accelerated lending to the 17 most heavily indebted countries .",
            "But the new money is being swamped by interest payments , and commercial banks are putting up little new money of their own .",
            "In 1986 , the 17 nations paid back lenders $ 18 billion more than they got in new loans .",
            "Also that year , the World Bank took back in repayments $ 291 million more than it pumped into the three largest Latin debtors -- Brazil , Mexico and Argentina .",
            "Last year , that was reversed ; the three countries received a $ 719 million inflow .",
            "However , that again was more than offset by commercial-bank outflows .",
            "Rep. Joseph Kennedy III , a Massachusetts Democrat , charges that `` the World Bank is just laundering funds that go back to the banks . ''",
            "Like Secretary Baker , Mr. Conable instinctively dismisses sweeping debt-relief plans as coercive or non-market-oriented .",
            "He rejects any notion that the bank might get involved in directly refinancing or providing security for debt on a broad scale .",
            "`` We are not there to try and handle their short-term debt problems , and if you think we are , then I think you misunderstand the nature of this institution , '' he says .",
