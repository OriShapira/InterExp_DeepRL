            "As rescuers worked underneath floodlights to remove bodies from the crash site , original estimates of the death toll -- one as high as 190 , which would have made the crash the second worst in U.S. history -- were reduced .",

            "Some aviation experts , speculating on why Flight 232 crashed after completing less than half of its scheduled 930-mile trip to Chicago , suggested that the explosion of the tail engine sent shards of metal through the tail section , somehow destroying common lines that serve the three hydraulic systems .",
            "There were reports from passengers and observers that the plane 's right-wing engine also failed before the crash .",
            "In what survivors described as a heroic effort that nearly succeeded , the plane 's Seattle-based captain , A. C. Haynes -- a 33-year veteran of the airline who along with the other 10 crew members survived the crash -- struggled for a half-hour to maintain control of the wobbling plane .",
            "Radio transmission indicated the plane 's maneuverability was limited to right-hand turns .",

            "The wing hit the ground a half-mile before the runway .",

            "Survival Rate Remarkable C. O. Miller , former chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board , said the crash 's survival rate was remarkable and was probably the result of the pilot 's ability to maneuver the plane close to the ground before losing complete control .",
            "`` If an airplane cartwheels , it is very fortuitous that anybody got out , '' said Miller , now a private aviation safety consultant in Sidona , Ariz .",
            "He said the huge mass of the DC-10 must have helped the pilot slow the plane as it approached the ground and helped keep portions of it intact .",
