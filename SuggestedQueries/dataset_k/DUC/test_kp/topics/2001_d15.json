            "Doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in recent years among people at high risk of AIDS , especially drug addicts .",
            "In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections , not new exposures to the bacteria , in people who also are infected with the AIDS virus .",
            "The doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting tuberculosis themselves , AIDS-infected addicts who carry the TB bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with , to health care workers and other people .",
            "`` The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance , '' wrote Dr. Peter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York .",
            "People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick .",
            "While most people with the AIDS virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome , people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB .",
            "HIV _ the AIDS viurus _ weakens the body 's defenses against disease .",
            "The study suggests that it lowers resistance to the tuberculosis bacteria , putting people at much higher risk of TB .",
            "The study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadone program .",
            "When the study began , 42 percent already were infected with HIV .",
            "Twenty-three percent of those with HIV also carried TB bacteria as did 20 percent of those who were free of the AIDS virus .",
            "During almost two years of followup , active tuberculosis developed in eight of the AIDS-infected people , but in none of those who did not have HIV .",
            "Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in people who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the study began .",
            "The doctors noted that 13 people who carried HIV and TB bacteria were treated with the drug isoniazid , and none of them went on to get active tuberculosis .",
            "However , seven of 36 people with both infections who did not take the medicine got TB .",
            "The doctors said that the drug is now administered along with daily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted ."

            "Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a survey in 29 states , where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 inmates in 1984-85 , compared with eight cases per 100,000 reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during the same period .",
            "`` In some large correctional systems , the incidence of TB has increased dramatically , '' the CDC said , noting that in New York state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78 .",
            "In New Jersey , inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987 , 11 times higher than the general New Jersey population .",
            "In California , the rate was nearly six times higher _ 80 per 100,000 .",

            "The CDC 's Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis is recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staff members _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferring through for less than a week .",
            "The CDC committee also recommends new tests at least once a year , rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms , and isolation _ off the prison property , if necessary _ for those with suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases .",
            "The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in the spread of TB in prisons , the CDC said .",

            "Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do , and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease , according to a study today .",
            "The research found that when living conditions are identical , black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria .",
            "The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty .",
            "While social factors undoubtedly play a central role , the study suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes .",
            "`` We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks , '' said Dr. William W. Stead .",
            "`` Whites seem to be more able to fend off the organism without it 's ever being able to establish an infection . ''",
            "Stead , a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of Health , discovered the racial difference while analyzing health statistics from nursing homes and prisons .",
            "`` It 's a very intriguing finding , '' commented Dr. George Comstock of Johns Hopkins University .",

            "Of the total six times difference , what proportion is attributable to biology and what to social factors ?",
            "I would say that biology is relatively minor . ''",
            "Stead 's study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , was based largely on a review of 25,398 elderly people who were free of TB infection when they were admitted to Arkansas nursing homes .",
            "When they were retested at least two months later , 14 percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new infections .",
            "Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the bacteria while incarcerated .",
            "Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB bacteria , which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis .",
            "About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States , resulting in 1,700 deaths .",
            "In the population at large , tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites .",
            "An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infected with the bacteria but not sick .",
            "The disease , which attacks the lungs , has long been associated with poor , crowded living conditions .",
            "Stead 's study found that blacks got infected more readily than whites , regardless of the race of the person who initially brought the infection into the nursing home .",
            "In homes where the initial source of the disease was white , 17 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites caught the infection .",
            "When the primary source was black , 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the bacteria .",
            "This phase of the study also suggests , however , that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks .",
            "Stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses against TB , because the bacteria has long been common in Europe and parts of Africa north of the Sahara , but is traditionally rare in sub-Saharan Africa .",
            "By contrast , blacks are genetically more resistant than whites to malaria , which is common in Africa .",
            "In the other study , Dr. Alfred Crowle of Webb-Waring Lung Institute at the University of Colorado found differences in the resistance of germ-eating blood cells called macrophages .",
            "In blacks , these cells are more likely to harbor TB infections .",
            "`` This helps explain why black people are more susceptible to tuberculosis than are white people , '' said Crowle .",
            "At the turn of the century , TB was the nation 's leading cause of death .",
            "The number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until 1984 .",
            "Experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of the emergence of the AIDS virus , which weaken the body 's resistance to TB bacteria .",

            "A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected , federal health researchers say .",
            "In 1988 , the last year for which complete statistics are available , 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported , down 0.4 percent from 1987 , the national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday .",

            "AIDS leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious illnesses , including TB , and studies have found that about 4 percent of AIDS patients also are listed as TB patients .",

            "`` In those tight buildings , they continue to recirculate it , and they probably build up . ''",
            "Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive .",
            "Flu and colds will probably never be eliminated from the workplace entirely , and it may not make sense to install a new ventilation system unless the air quality is very low .",
            "In his tuberculosis study , he found that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation systems that allow very little fresh air .",
            "If the ventilation is moderately effective but not ideal , further improvements yield only a slight decrease in infectious illness .",
