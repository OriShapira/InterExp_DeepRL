            "`` Part of it is tradition , '' Smallwood said .",

            "`` They just happened to be driving through an area they thought needed to be burned out . ''",
            "Still , the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simply misguided citizen .",
            "`` Part of the problem is people driving around drinking and shooting road signs , '' Smallwood said .",

            "The fire was so intense that a gray shadow on the forest floor is all that remains of a fallen log .",
            "Where many people recoil at the sweep of nature 's destructive power , the 47-year-old Mr. Despain marvels at the tiny steps life is already taking to renew itself .",
            "As Yellowstone National Park 's research biologist , he has already begun to monitor the forest 's rebirth from the worst fire on record .",
            "His eyes red from the blowing ash , Mr. Despain patiently counts the quarter-inch lodgepole pine seed `` wings '' within a rectangular frame he places on the hillside .",
            "The tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames ; indeed , they require a fire to propagate themselves .",

            "In recent years , environmentalists have for the most part succeeded in promoting the natural processes of the parks .",
            "But the approach is again under attack .",
            "The National Park Service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old `` natural burn '' policy , which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out , except where they threaten towns or park buildings .",
            "Critics , including elected officials from Western states and the logging and tourist industries , have grabbed headlines by blaming that policy for fueling the inferno that this summer raged over half of Yellowstone 's 2.2 million acres and cost more than $ 100 million to fight and clean up .",
            "Reforestation would give wooded areas in Yellowstone a `` five-year jump '' on natural regrowth of the woods and would `` get it green again , '' says John Davis , Willamette Industries Inc. 's general manager for Western timber logging operations in Lewiston , Idaho .",
            "Gerald M. Freeman , the president and chief operating officer of Stone Forest Industries Inc. , agrees : `` Controlled burning , selective logging and reforestation are a much better way to manage the forests . ''",
            "The pressure to bring back Yellowstone 's forest through reforestation may get intense .",
            "In an average year , 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park , and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business .",
            "In August , with fires out of control , the tourist trade was off 30 % here .",
            "The emotional appeal of replanting the parks already has led to some reforestation proposals -- some of them a bit off the wall .",

            "True , fire boundaries within the park cover about half the park 's acreage .",
            "Yet only 10 % to 15 % of land within these boundaries was scorched by raging crown fires that burn everything in sight , Mr. Varley estimates .",

            "Driving along the 140 miles of the park 's upper and lower scenic loop -- on roads open to park visitors -- one sees a Yellowstone that is a patchwork of green , brown and blackened forest and meadow .",
            "The burnt `` snags , '' as charred tree trunks are called , creak in the wind above Mr. Despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the Civil War .",
            "The slow-growing trees , only seven to 10 inches in diameter , were relatively young by Yellowstone standards .",
            "Most of the lodgepole stands here that burned this summer were 250 to 400 years old .",
            "Mr. Despain says it is no coincidence that most burnt trees here were senior citizens , relatively speaking , and highly susceptible to fire .",
            "As lodgepoles age , they lose some of their natural resistance to disease and insects .",
            "Dead trees fall to the forest floor , joined by others blown over by the strong winds howling down from surrounding peaks .",
            "The thinning canopy then lets more light through to the forest floor .",
            "Grasses and shrubs , some of their seeds having lain dormant for 100 years or more , fill in the open spaces between the trees .",

            "But less than an inch beneath the surface the searing stops .",
            "Seeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire , he says , and will germinate next spring .",
            "Meanwhile , nutrients that were bound up in the cells of mature pines for hundreds of years have been returned in the form of ash to the soil as fertilizer for next year 's growth .",
            "Carol Shively , a park ranger-naturalist at Grant Village in Yellowstone , says , `` Next spring is going to be a spectacular one for wildflowers . ''",
            "For the first five years after a fire , while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low , there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park , she says .",
            "In addition to fireweed and wild geraniums , lupen , yarrow , mountain dandelion and arnica have already been spotted this year among the ashes .",
            "Aspen trees , whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year , also thrive after a fire .",
            "With their roots undamaged by the flames , aspen trees return to their juvenile phase for three to four years , and will add as much as four feet in a 90-day growing season .",
            "Yellowstone 's meadows rebound the fastest after a fire .",
            "By next July , one will find it difficult to tell which meadows burned in 1988 .",
            "One clue will be that the Idaho fescue , blue bunch wheat grass and pine grass growing in fields where fire returned nutrients to the soil will be as much as a foot taller than the meadows that escaped the flames .",
            "Forests visited only by ground fires will rebound almost as quickly .",
            "Shrubs and grasses cover what is left of the burnt undergrowth , although fire scars will be visible on some trees for years .",
            "The completely burned forests will remain a mixture of meadow and snags for several years .",
            "Insects begin attacking the snags almost immediately after a fire , and the charred trunks are likely to be toppled by the wind .",
            "But many snags , weathering to fence-post gray , will remain as monuments to the fire of 1988 for years to come .",
            "Lodgepole pine seedlings grow as much as a foot a year in the open , although a few inches per year is more common at first .",
            "Hundreds of plant species proliferate after a fire until `` canopy closure '' is achieved in about 40 years .",
            "At that point , the pines -- still less than 15 feet tall -- begin to choke off light reaching the forest floor as their limbs grow together .",
            "As lodgepoles come to dominate the ecosystem , other plant species decline in number , reaching a low of no more than a dozen in the mature forest .",
            "The mature forest `` has the least biological diversity of any habitat in the park , '' Mr. Varley says .",
            "Then the forest thins as it ages , trees fall , underbrush grows , and the forest is primed for a fire to start its life cycle over again .",
            "Mark Palmer , the chairman of the Sierra Club 's national wildlife committee , sees another virtue in the aftermath of a fire : `` Meadows are much more valuable to wildlife than dense forests . ''",

            "It 's too early to tell whether the fires , which burned some lower pastures , affected the herds ' ability to weather Yellowstone 's long winter .",
            "More winterkill among the herds might be expected this year in any case , since animal populations are now near their historical upper limits .",
