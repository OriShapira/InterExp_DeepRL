            "The symptoms are very much like scrapie , a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s .",
            "The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims ; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly .",
            "The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed , which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement .",
            "The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June 1988 , and later banned the use of cattle brain , spleen , thymus , intestines and spinal cord in food for humans .",

            "The disease struck one of his own cows , Gourlay said .",

            "The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable .",
            "The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows .",
            "The zoo 's small herd of kudu , spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows , has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) .",
            "Of eight animals born in the herd since 1987 , five have contracted the disease .",
            "Only one of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep , believed to be the origin of the outbreak .",
            "The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows .",
            "It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations , the cheetah and the puma , in eland and nyala , and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx .",
            "In the United States , mink have been affected by it .",
            "The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown , but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others .",
            "Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births , but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely .",
            "In THE VETERINARY RECORD , the scientists eliminate most routes of infection .",
            "Infected feed can not account for four cases .",
            "Nor can at least three of the affected animals have caught the disease from their mothers , who did not suffer from it .",
            "It is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers that passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves .",
            "If this were so , it would have important implications for the disease in cows .",
            "It is more likely , the scientists believe , that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along , as with more mundane infections .",
            "Because of the danger to other animals , the kudu herd has been isolated .",
            "Another danger taken seriously by the zoo , a world centre for breeding rare and endangered species , is that animals bred in captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild .",
            "If they proved as vulnerable as the kudu , this could be disastrous .",
            "The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows .",
            "If it is , the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease .",
            "If , however , it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form , the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger .",

            "It is bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- `` mad cow '' disease -- and few would be prepared to say exactly when and where it will end .",

            "Nonsense , say British government scientists .",
            "Meanwhile , the controversy in Britain is reaching new heights .",
            "Last week , the scientific journal Nature called for a start to be made on replacing the British cattle population with animals free from the infection -- which the magazine estimate would cost \u00a330 billion .",
            "Next day , one of the farming industry 's loudest voices , the magazine Farmers Weekly hit back at what it called `` a diet of speculation , half-truths and downright lies '' and denounced what it called `` certain publicity-hungry scientists promoted by the media more interested in fiction than fact . ''",
            "Calling on the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food ( MAFF ) to do more to explain the disease , the magazine concluded : `` The alternative is to exacerbate the current climate of fear and uncertainty ... '' The fear is not just that shared by farmers worried about their livelihood .",
            "Could it transfer itself from cows to humans ?",
            "`` Mad Cow '' disease was probably first observed on a farm in Kent in 1985 , when four animals were put down after they were observed drooling , staggering before collapsing .",
            "Scientists at the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Surrey found that the animals ' brains had become holed and spongelike -- similar symptoms to the disease scrapie in sheep and the rare Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) , in humans .",
            "MAFF scientists concluded that BSE had appeared in cattle given processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep .",
            "New rendering methods , reducing the temperature at which the feed was prepared , were enabling the infective agent to survive , they concluded .",
            "Acting on this advice , in July 1988 , John MacGregor , then Agriculture Minister , introduced a ban on such ruminant protein being used in feed .",
            "Cattle confirmed as having BSE have been put down and incinerated , with the ashes being buried .",
            "In 1989 a further ban was introduced , on cattle offal sold for human consumption .",
            "That year it was officially predicted that 20,000 animals would be affected before the feed ban , together with the drying up of any supplies already on farms , had its effect .",
            "But the spread of BSE has confounded original expectations .",
            "The Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday that by the beginning of last week the total number of cattle diagnosed since November 1986 as having BSE had risen to 121,898 -- six times the original prediction .",
            "The ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died is that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after the ban .",
            "Last week , MAFF said that the numbers of confirmed BSE cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof , the ministry says , that the epidemic is waning .",
            "Yet there is still controversy .",
            "Some 8,004 cattle have died from BSE despite being born after the feed ban was introduced .",
            "MAFF says 5,767 of these were born before the end of 1988 , and were probably fed from remaining infected supplies .",
            "That theory has been assailed by critics of the ministry .",
            "Mark Purdey , a Somerset farmer and independent researcher , believes that the use of organophosphate pesticides , used from the 1980s as a sheep dip and to treat warble-fly infestation in cattle , could have damaged the animals ' immune system , exposing them to the disease .",
            "Ministry scientists , originally dismissive , are now reassessing his theories .",
            "More recently , researchers have suggested that in some cattle , BSE has been `` vertically '' transmitted from cow to calf .",
            "Given a long incubation period , such a possibility could make the disease harder to eradicate .",
            "This month 19 cattle have died on farms where MAFF is conducting a seven-year experiment into the disease .",
            "It is a daunting possibility for the farming industry , which has responded angrily .",
            "`` There is no evidence that this disturbing disease can be transferred from cow to calf , '' Farmers Weekly insisted last week .",
            "More cautiously , MAFF told The Sunday Telegraph : `` We have never said we have ruled out the possibility of maternal transmission , but even if it occurs , our scientists do not believe it will do anything other than lengthen the time before the disease is eradicated . ''",
            "So how long will it be before the epidemic is ended ?",
            "Richard North , a former environmental health officer turned consultant , and a contributor to The Sunday Telegraph , believes that MAFF 's statistics are being skewed to produce more optimistic figures -- claims not surprisingly rejected by the ministry .",
            "Mr North said : `` We have more than 8,000 cattle born after the feed ban that have subsequently contracted BSE .",
            "The claim that all of these are affected by illegally retained infected feed gets less credible by the hour . ''",
            "One question -- perhaps the most important -- remains .",
            "If the disease has jumped from sheep to cattle -- and cases have also been reported in kudu antelope at London Zoo -- could it affect humans ?",
            "That prospect , discounted by most scientists -- including MAFF critics such as Mr Purdey -- is considered a possibility by Richard Lacey , a Leeds University microbiologist who has been studying cases of CJD , a disease with a long incubation period .",
            "Reviled by the farming industry and privately disparaged by MAFF , he nevertheless insists that there may be a threat .",

            "He should know , having chased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won a Nobel Prize in the process .",
            "Recently the fascination has taken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans and animals with suspicious regularity in several places , underscoring a longstanding question : Do people get the disease from animals ?",
            "The question has burned with special intensity since scrapie , the form of the disease in sheep , jumped to British cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of infected sheep .",
            "About 20,000 British cattle have been destroyed since 1986 in hopes of eradicating the spongiform `` mad cow '' disease , which makes the animals jittery before they keel over .",
            "A few weeks ago , the first confirmed case of mad cow disease outside Britain turned up in Switzerland .",
            "U.S. meat producers have reason to be anxious about this because the incidence of scrapie has been rising in American sheep since the mid-1980s , says Richard Marsh , a University of Wisconsin scrapie expert .",
            "Scientists agree , however , that the disease in animals probably poses little danger to people .",
            "Scrapie has existed for centuries and `` the world is bathed '' in its infectious agent , says Dr. Gajdusek .",

            "The outbreak has become something of an epidemic around the Orava area , where 26 cases have occurred since 1987 , a rate hundreds of times higher than normal for CJD .",
            "Residents of the affected areas `` are very afraid , '' says Dr. Mitrova .",
            "She has found evidence of scrapie in the area 's sheep .",
            "Now villagers there call CJD `` our sheep disease . ''",
            "That 's a leap of folklore , though , and the sheep link may well turn out to be false , cautions Dr. Mitrova .",
            "Indeed , CJD is a nefarious trickster ; the first reported case of the disease , which entered medical texts in the 1920s , really was n't CJD after all , scientists now believe .",
            "And it usually strikes so rarely and randomly -- killing about one in a million people world-wide each year -- that scientists did n't even begin to suspect it was infectious until 1957 .",
            "That year , the NIH 's Dr. Gajdusek , then a young scientist casting about for big questions , planned a trip to Papua New Guinea to visit a friend .",
            "He never arrived .",
            "En route , he heard that a primitive New Guinea tribe , the Fore , were dying in droves from an unknown brain disorder they called kuru , `` the shivering disease , '' because it started with tremors .",
            "Fascinated , he dropped everything , plunged into the backwoods with a local doctor and took charge of investigating the affair , to the great annoyance of Australian authorities then overseeing the area .",
            "`` Gajdusek ... has an intelligence quotient up in the 180s and the emotional immaturity of a 15-year-old , '' one of his mentors warned the Australians in a letter , and `` wo n't let danger , physical difficulty , or other people 's feelings interfere in the least with what he wants to do . ''",
            "In short , he was perfect for the job .",
            "Soon kuru victims ' brains started issuing from the heart of darkness to distant medical centers , compliments of Dr. Gajdusek .",
            "He swapped axes and salt for autopsy rights , dissecting one victim with a carving knife by lantern-light in a native hut during a howling storm , according to his letters home .",
            "He and the local doctor , Vincent Zigas , tried everything from tranquilizers to hormones on kuru patients .",
            "Nothing helped .",
            "The cause remained elusive .",
            "Two years later , William Hadlow , a U.S. veterinarian , saw a picture of one of the kuru brains in a medical journal and was struck by its spongy appearance .",
            "He had seen that look before in scrapie , the sheep disease , and put in a call to the NIH .",
            "Another link fell into place when Igor Klatzo , an NIH scientist , noticed kuru brains resembled ones from CJD victims .",
            "Based on the clues , Dr. Gajdusek , back at NIH , led studies in the 1960s showing kuru , CJD and scrapie to be essentially the same infectious disease , studies that won the 1976 Nobel Prize for medicine .",
            "The discoveries confirmed a long-suspected connection : The kuru outbreak sprang from a Fore mourning ritual , in which relatives ate their deceased kin 's lightly cooked , and often kuru-infected , brains .",
            "But the infectious agent continued to baffle scientists .",
            "It somehow could hide in the brain for decades without causing the usual signs of infection , such as fever .",
            "Brain tissue of infected animals could transmit the disease when injected into different animals ' brains , yet microscopes revealed no signs of infectious microbes .",
            "And why did the agent sporadically appear in people with no known exposure ?",
            "It seemed like `` biological spontaneous combustion , '' says NIH researcher Paul Brown .",
            "In the early 1980s , scientists discovered that CJD , like Alzheimer 's disease , often gums up the brain with a kind of junk , or `` amyloid , '' protein .",
            "Further studies showed the junk mainly contains a botched form of a naturally occurring brain protein , sometimes called a prion .",
            "Many scientists now believe it 's the culprit .",
            "But their theory entails a biologically weird premise : that the altered protein replicates itself without the aid of genetic material , the basis of all known reproduction .",
            "If they 're right , such self-replicating proteins might be representatives of an ancient twilight zone between life and nonlife-evolution 's bridge between molecules and microbes .",
            "When formed in a brain cell , a molecule of such stuff might be `` like a bad apple in a barrel converting all the other apples , '' says the NIH 's Dr. Brown .",
            "A hot question : Does the amyloid in Alzheimer 's disease form similarly ?",
            "All this , however , does n't explain what happened after Dr. Brown baked isolates of the disease agent for an hour at 680 degrees Fahrenheit , a temperature that melts proteins .",
            "He injected the ashy residue into animals ' brains , expecting nothing to happen .",
            "But a few of them got spongiform disease .",
            "He also buried isolates in his garden for three years and found they remained infectious .",
            "The results may be `` very disquieting , '' he says , to British farmers , who have been burning and burying mad cow corpses .",
            "Still , Dr. Brown and other scientists are n't much worried about mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform disease is very hard to transmit orally .",
            "Eating huge doses of the agent is required .",
            "Perhaps the mad cows got such doses `` every time they went to the feedbag , '' says Dr. Brown .",
            "Kuru victims apparently consumed similar mega-doses .",
            "And so may have Max .",
            "He was a Siamese cat in Bristol , England , that died last spring .",
            "Examining his brain , a veterinarian found a telltale sponginess , sparking another round of panic in the U.K. about spongiform disease .",
            "Now more than 10 British cats have died of it , suggesting brains from infected sheep or cows got into cat food .",
            "Meanwhile , yet another spongiform outbreak has occurred , this time among northeastern Pennsylvanians .",
            "The cluster of more than a dozen CJD cases `` is n't an epidemic '' and appears to have topped out in 1989 , says Brian Little , an Allentown neuropathologist leading a study of it .",
            "But it is worrisome because , like the Slovakian outbreak , it suggests a common underlying cause that could strike again .",
            "During the past few months , the NIH team , working with Dr. Mitrova , has found a thread that for the first time may link many such CJD cases .",
            "The discovery began when the scientists ferreted out a genetic defect in two U.S. brothers who had died of CJD .",
            "In itself , that was nothing new .",
            "Scientists have long known that CJD runs in some families and therefore suspected a genetic problem .",
            "But Dr. Brown 's excitement grew when three other , unrelated CJD victims were found to carry the same genetic defect .",
            "`` On a flyer , '' he says , `` I called relatives of the victims and struck gold . ''",
            "They were all of Eastern European descent , suggesting people of similar ancestry might carry the gene .",
            "Drs .",
            "Brown and Gajdusek knew just where to look for such people .",
            "They grabbed a plane for Czechoslovakia .",
            "Since then , the team has confirmed that many of the Slovakian CJD victims , and a cluster of Libyan-born Jews whose tissues were preserved , carried the defect .",
            "The findings suggest one of two things : Either the defect alone produces the deadly agent or it predisposes its carriers to get CJD when they are exposed to the agent .",
            "The findings have opened the door for early diagnosis and possible prevention of CJD .",
            "But they also have introduced a new riddle , says Dr. Gajdusek : Why has the genetic defect , which has apparently existed for decades in some Eastern Europeans , turned deadly only in the past 15 years or so ?",
            "`` Essentially , we 're stuck with another paradox , '' he adds .",
