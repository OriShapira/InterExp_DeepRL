            "`` The best way to learn to work is to work , '' the president said in a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20 miles north of here .",
            "Rep. Thomas J. Downey , D-N.Y. , in the Democrats ' response , said that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary , but he said such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare officials , not the federal government .",
            "Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his administration 's economic record , saying Friday 's unemployment figures showed that the jobless rate `` hovered just above the lowest it 's been in 14 years . ''",
            "The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6 percent , up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3 per cent , which was a 14-year low .",
            "`` But there are still some Americans whom our expansion has passed by _ those caught in the welfare trap , '' he said .",
            "To deal with this , he said , his administration launched a program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get people off the welfare rolls .",
            "`` Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work , '' the president said .",
            "`` Now , Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare reform and I have a message for them , '' he said .",
            "`` I will not accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people independent of welfare . ''",
            "A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it a Senate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and a House-approved measure that does not .",
            "`` Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform , '' the president said .",
            "`` If Congress presents me with a bill that replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on welfare , I will use my veto pen . ''",
            "Downey said that while more people than ever before are working , `` the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better off today than he or she was 10 years ago ; in fact things have gotten worse . ''",
            "The poorest 40 percent of American families , with incomes adjusted for inflation , are worse off today than they were 10 years ago ; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade ago ; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty , he said .",
            "The House bill , with training and education programs as well as health and child-care benefits , would make welfare parents who work better off than those who do not , said Downey , acting chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment compensation .",
            "`` Yes , requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary , but those requirements should be controlled by state and local officials who administer our welfare programs , not federal bureaucrats , '' Downey said ."

            "He told the National Governors ' Association that he was committed to 'ending welfare as we know it ' with measures to finance expanded job training for the unemployed , matched by a requirement that people must do some kind of work for their welfare cheque .",
            "The president said he would focus on better implementation of the Family Support Act , a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force which he , as governor of Arkansas , co-chaired .",

            "Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration 's intentions , fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes .",

            "As a result , few states have been able to implement in full the act 's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training .",
            "Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle that 'welfare should be a second chance , not a way of life ' .",
            "There must be ' a certain time beyond which people do n't draw a cheque for doing nothing , ' he said .",
            "But at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap by providing them with continued health coverage , child care , and expanded earned income tax credits when they took jobs .",

            "President Bill Clinton 's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it ' was one of the most popular lines in last year 's election campaign .",
            "His idea of a strict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters ( especially 'Reagan democrats ' ) not just as a way of cutting government spending and thus reducing taxes , but as a solution to the nation 's most pressing social problems .",
            "In the American mind , welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban decay , fatherless children , drug abuse and violent crime .",
            "By promising radical welfare reform , Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message : he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society .",
            "Since becoming president , Mr Clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare , raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former President George Bush 's 'read my lips : no new taxes ' pledge .",
            "The White House insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just had to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities : the deficit reduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform scheduled for September .",
            "It claims both measures will help shift people off welfare by 'making work pay . '",
            "The budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit ( a kind of negative income tax ) .",
            "This gives poor working families a cash bonus of up to Dollars 2,500 a year , increasing the incentive to take low paid jobs .",
            "If healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers , welfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that they stand to lose their health care benefits .",
            "In addition , the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially .",
            "Such measures should help .",
            "But they are hardly going to solve America 's welfare problem , which differs substantially from that in Europe .",
            "In keeping with Franklin Roosevelt 's dictum that a permanent dole is ' a narcotic , a subtle destroyer of the human spirit ' , the US has never provided permanent welfare support for single , able-bodied adults .",
            "When pundits talk of a 'culture of welfare ' they are referring mainly to the Dollars 20bn spent on Aid for Families with Dependent Children , a benefit received by 5m single-parent families .",
            "The objection is not that some families in straitened circumstances need AFDC as a short-term prop , but that half of those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life .",
            "So what should Mr Clinton do ?",
            "Many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit .",
            "Once people accept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely , they argue , behaviour will change .",
            "Teenagers will stop having babies and start recognising the economic advantages of marriage .",

            "If welfare stops , something has to take its place .",
            "One suggestion is that Mr Clinton should follow the example of Roosevelt 's Works Progress Administration , an agency that at its peak created over 3m public sector jobs .",
            "After two years , welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage .",
            "Mothers with young children would also be offered state child care facilities .",
            "According to one advocate , this would amount to replacing the welfare state by the 'work ethic state ' .",
            "This solution is more appealing than a mere cessation of benefits .",
            "But it would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps Dollars 50-60bn a year , far more than the Clinton administration is willing to spend on welfare reform .",
            "Fortunately there is a fall back position for Mr Clinton : the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988 , which he helped steer through Congress .",
            "This recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set targets for the gradual introduction of 'workfare ' .",
            "Next year states will receive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least 15 per cent of the 'employable ' welfare case load is working or in training programmes ; by 1995 the required ratio rises to 20 per cent .",
            "These seemingly undemanding targets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take jobs at some point during the year .",
            "Mr Clinton could tighten the definition of 'employable ' , so as to include mothers with children under the age of three , and set more demanding workfare participation targets , for example that 50 per cent of welfare recipients should be working or in training by the year 2000 .",
            "Such a gradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective .",

            "Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992 .",
            "In the longer term , there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years .",

            "Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD , as countries struggle to rein in government spending .",
            "Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990 .",
            "The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions , healthcare , unemployment benefits and family support .",

            "Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period .",

            "Improvements in pension benefits , such as automatic increases to match rising earnings .",

            "Countries such as Spain , Ireland and the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to provide universal coverage .",
            "As with pensions , health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example , including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental .",
            "The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs , though not as much as for pensions .",
            "Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families .",
            "But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits , which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers .",
            "Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s , and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes .",

            "Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these .",
            "But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future .",
            "The most important of these is demography .",
            "Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions .",
            "The number of over-65s in the 24 OECD member states rose from 61m in 1960 to more than 100m in 1990 .",

            "Only halfway through the 21st century will the number of over-65s peak , at about 190m .",
            "The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age .",
            "The standard measure for this is the age dependency ratio , the population over 65 as a percentage of the population aged 15-64 .",
            "For the OECD as a whole , the age dependency ratio is predicted to rise from about 19 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent by 2020 and 37 per cent by 2040 .",

            "By 2040 , almost half of Germany 's population could be over 65 , though the proportion will fall thereafter .",
            "Age dependency ratios will climb more slowly in the UK and US , to about 25 per cent in 2020 - four people of working age to support every elderly person .",
            "In both countries , ratios will peak at about 33 per cent in 2040 .",
            "The most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions , where costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature .",
            "Overall , the OECD estimates that the pension burden could double over the next 50 years .",
            "Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms .",
            "In practice , increasing pensions in line with prices might be difficult to sustain if earnings rose faster .",
            "The growing gap between pensioners and those still at work that would result could be politically unacceptable .",
            "However , raising pensions by more than prices would either require much higher growth rates or higher taxes for those in work to pay the bill .",
            "The impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs is less clear-cut .",
            "Experts differ on whether increased longevity inevitably means more medical care : while more might be required for the very elderly , less might be needed for younger people as chronic diseases become less common .",
            "Additional costs of new drugs and advances in medical technology could be at least as important as demography in pushing up healthcare bills .",
            "However , there will be an increase in demand for geriatric care and social services for the elderly .",
            "This will be encouraged by social changes , such as the decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by younger relatives .",

            "In some countries , the increase has been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as France , Japan and Switzerland .",

            "In the US the number has more than doubled .",

            "The reasons for the growth include the greater ease of separation and divorce .",
            "But inevitably lone-parent families rely on welfare provision to a far greater extent than two-parent families .",
            "Added to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the increase in unemployment levels across the OECD .",
            "Over the past two decades , jobless levels have risen during recessions but not fallen back to the same extent in the following recovery period .",
            "This ratchet effect has worried the Group of Seven leading industrial countries sufficiently for an employment summit to be hosted by President Clinton in the coming months .",
            "Continuing rises in the base level of unemployment would further undermine countries ' ability to pay for their welfare states .",
            "Responses to these cost pressures vary from country to country .",
            "Germany , the UK , France , Italy and the US are among countries that have already raised tax and social security contribution levels .",
            "However , the scope for such increases is limited by voters ' reluctance to pay higher taxes .",
            "Where the cost of welfare is jointly funded by employers - as in Germany - higher contributions are also increasingly resisted by business , which fears the consequences for international competitiveness of higher costs .",
            "In a global economy , no country can long afford to burden business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours .",
            "An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state .",

            "Without either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets , current welfare spending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points over the next 40 years , according to one OECD study .",
            "It says this is ' a situation which most would think unsustainable ' .",
            "This is why the OECD 's half-yearly Economic Outlook repeatedly stresses the importance of controlling welfare spending in improving economic performance .",
            "The OECD 's immediate priorities for reform include charges for the use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the efficiency of those services .",
            "But the OECD has also drawn attention to the need for action to anticipate the funding implications of the rise in the number of elderly people .",
            "Tackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with charges and efficiency drives in welfare services .",
            "Significant cuts in benefit levels , for example , may be needed - including greater targeting of benefits on the most needy .",
            "User charges could become increasingly widespread , especially for the better-off .",
