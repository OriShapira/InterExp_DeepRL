            "The court said the `` state 's strong interests in protecting against an entrenched , dynastic legislative bureaucracy '' outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box .",
            "But the court 's decision affected only term limits on state officials ; federal officeholders were n't included in California 's limits .",

            "They have never held reasonable , non-discriminatory restrictions on who may run a violation of the right to vote .",
