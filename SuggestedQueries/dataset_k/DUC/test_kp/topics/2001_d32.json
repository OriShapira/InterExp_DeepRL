            "The biggest oil spill in U.S. history created a slick about seven miles long and seven miles wide in Prince William Sound .",
            "The Coast Guard said only Reef Island and the western edge of Bligh Island had been touched by the slick .",
            "`` This situation , I think , was everyone 's secret nightmare about what could happen with oil traffic in the sound , '' said Dennis Kelso , commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation .",
            "Some 240,000 barrels _ about 10,080,000 gallons _ of crude oil from Alaska 's North Slope spilled early Friday when the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez ran hard aground on Bligh Reef , about 25 miles outside Valdez , where it had taken on a total cargo of 1.2 million barrels .",
            "Initial reports indicated 270,000 barrels had spilled .",
            "`` What we have here is a major environmental catastrophe , '' said one oil spill expert , Richard Golob of Boston , publisher of Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin .",
            "Golob said cleanup equipment at the site was `` grossly inadequate '' but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup efforts would not have significantly reduced the spill 's impact .",
            "`` It is an enclosed body of water , '' he said .",
            "`` The only way for this oil to ecape out to the sea is by traversing the entire length of Prince William Sound with all its islands , fjords and bays and channels .",
            "`` And during that transit , undoubtedly a large stretch of shoreline will be contaminated , '' he said .",
            "Divers Saturday said they had found six to eight holes in the vessel 's hull large enough to swim through , said Frank Iarossi , president of Exxon Shipping Co. About 30 feet of the vessel is resting on a shelf on the reef .",
            "Efforts to begin pumping 200,000 gallons of oil off the Exxon Valdez onto another tanker , the Exxon Baton Rouge , were halted early Saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to leaking as the pumping operation proceeded .",
            "Eleven of 17 tanks that lie forward of the ship 's masthead were ruptured in the accident , causing concern over removal of the oil , said Coast Guard Lt. Ed Wieliczkiewicz .",
            "`` Whenever you start removing oil from a vessel this size it has to be done in a controlled manner , '' Wieliczkiewicz said .",
            "`` If it 's not ... you endanger the stability of the vessel . ''",
            "Wieliczkiewicz said a boom was placed around the Exxon Valdez and the Exxon Baton Rouge to help contain oil around the vessels .",
            "He also said four members of the Coast Guard 's Pacific Strike Team from San Francisco , specially trained to deal with pollution and oil spills , arrived Saturday and were helping to rig pumps and assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the Baton Rouge .",
            "Kelso was highly critical of what he said was a slow response to the spill .",
            "`` The initial reponse was inadequate and unacceptable , '' he said before a news conference Saturday .",
            "Kelso said the efforts should have been under way in five hours , but took much longer .",
            "`` You miss the opportunity right at the beginning and you 've missed our best opportunity to do something . ''",
            "Kelso said Alaska has a plan for oil spills that calls for action within five hours of a spill .",
            "It took several hours longer , he said , and only two of seven skimmers available to the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. were used at the outset .",
            "Alyeska spokesman Chuck O'Donnel said he was satisfied with his company 's actions .",
            "`` I think our people did an excellent job , '' he said .",
            "The spill 's effect on wildlife had not yet been assessed , but commercial fishermen who depend on the sound for a catch worth millions of dollars were outraged and said a key herring spawning area had been polluted .",
            "`` The whole food chain could be affected by the spill , '' said Alan Reichman , ocean ecology coordinator for the environmental group Greenpeace , in Seattle .",
            "`` There 's a high concentration of sea otter , waterfowl , sea birds and pink salmon in that area , '' said Steve Goldstein , a spokesman for the Interior Department in Washington .",
            "`` Some birds have already died , and we are doing our best to try to save the fish by containing the oil to the area where it presently is and by trying to skim it . ''",

            "It was unclear if a pilot was aboard the Exxon Valdez when it grounded .",
            "There was no decision Saturday on whether to use chemicals to disperse the oil , but a test of the dispersal method was being conducted Saturday afternoon , as was a test to determine whether at least some of the crude oil could be burned .",
