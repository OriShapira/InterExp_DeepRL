            "Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins on Friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon against Edward Brown of Cumberland .",
            "Prosecutors had argued that the amendment 's backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns , but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent .",

            "`` Maine 's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state amendments , '' he wrote .",
            "Attorney General James E. Tierney said Saturday that the case would be appealed , adding , `` With all due respect to Justice Perkins , we think he is wrong . ''",
            "The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms `` for the common defense . ''",
            "In 1986 , the Maine Supreme Court upheld a gun violation by focusing on the `` common defense '' phrase .",
            "In response , the Legislature enacted a constitutional amendment deleting that language , and voters approved it in November 1987 .",
            "The amendment declared , `` Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms , and this right shall never be questioned . ''",

            "The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady , the former White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns .",
            "It would give law enforcement authorities time to check the buyer 's background .",
            "Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho and Alaska , who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the US .",
            "The Brady bill 's opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience only law-abiding citizens , not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away from the government 's prying eyes .",
            "They point to glaring failings in the federal government 's policing of the 276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill 's likely ineffectiveness .",
            "For instance , one newspaper reporter successfully obtained a dealer 's licence for his dog by submitting a made-up social security number .",
            "Studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest , however , that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped , and some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun .",
            "But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of new or used firearms , let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation ; and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental deaths involving guns each year .",
            "'The longest journey begins with a single step , ' Mr Brady said after the bill 's final passage in the Senate on Wednesday .",
            "Despite its uncertain effect , passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control .",
            "Other initiatives in Congress and in state legislatures are under way : the Senate last week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons , a measure already in force in California , New Jersey and Connecticut .",

            "The strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in the face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has brought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150 per 100,000 , and led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools .",
            "The fear of violent crimes such as carjackings and drive-by shootings has spread even beyond the inner city and into the suburbs and the countryside , provoking a widespread feeling that something - anything - must be done .",
            "The message from an outraged public is not , however , unequivocally in favour of gun control .",
            "Paradoxically , while thousands of people have been telephoning their Republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the Brady bill , thousands have also been flocking to join the National Rifle Association , the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies .",

            "Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine guns , assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets .",
            "In the process they have lost touch with many of their members , who back gun control in general and specifically the Brady bill .",
            "Two trends over the past few years have weakened the advocates of gun rights .",
            "First , left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a supplement to tough anti-crime measures , rather than an alternative ; they have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime ' high ground by backing boot camps for young delinquents , harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on parole or habeas corpus appeals .",
            "The NRA is trying to fight back with a campaign called CrimeStrike , calling for harsher measures against criminals .",
            "Second , the NRA 's insistence on combating any gun control , even that viewed as reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners , has driven away some former political and police supporters .",

            "According to a Gallup poll earlier this year , 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in their house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms .",
            "These converts to gun control , however , are a long way from believing that the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action , such as the proposal of Senator John Chafee , a Rhode Island Republican , for a complete ban on handguns .",

            "Kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the Second Amendment , like other Bill of Rights protections , was intended to incorporate English common law rights of the time , which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia .",

            "Working from that decision and the common law , Kates says the amendment 's protection should be limited to weapons `` in common use among law-abiding people , '' useful for law enforcement or personal defense , and lineally descended from weapons known to the Framers .",

            "In suggesting , for example , that it would be fine to ban automatic rifles but not semi-automatics , Kates is slicing the constitutional salami pretty thin .",
            "But in what I suspect was the main purpose of his exercise -- establishing that a flat ban on handguns would be hard to justify under the Constitution -- Kates builds a distressingly good case .",

            "To her supporters , Hammer represents all that is strong about the NRA ; to her detractors , much that is weak .",
            "Attacking the crux of the bill , Hammer told the subcommittee : `` You can not differentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your routine sporting firearms because , functionally , they are the same . ''",
            "Next , she dealt acidly with one of the NRA 's prickliest political problems : `` There are some law-enforcement officers who are NRA members who are against us .",

            "Finally , as NRA Washington lobbyist Baker had done in his letter to Arizona gun owners , Hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the Florida bill would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns .",
            "That is , the ban would cover not just the targeted guns -- the ones with folding stocks that make them easy to conceal , pistol grips , huge ammunition clips and flash suppressors that , according to police , make it easy to spray bullets from the hip .",
            "But doomed as well , she claimed , would be firearms of traditional design long used by hunters and target shooters in one of the nation 's gun-owningest states .",

            "But asked if the NRA provides accurate information , he responded , with a backward glance at Hammer : `` Well , sometimes they get a little bit overzealous .",

            "Hammer faces another growing problem : competition from lobbyists on the other side .",
            "For instance , the day of the House subcommittee vote on assault weapons , she was outmaneuvered by Bernard Horn , the state legislative director for Handgun Control , who had flown in from Washington .",
            "Horn gave legislators a booklet picturing both the 27 guns proposed for banning and other semiautomatic rifles that were not on the list but that are popular with hunters .",
            "The move was aimed at shattering the NRA 's claim that only cosmetic differences exist between assault weapons and sporting guns .",

            "Because of the booklet , she said , she was no longer willing to support merely a limit on the capacity of ammunition clips -- a fallback position to which Hammer had reluctantly acceded .",
            "Now , Hanson said , she favored banning the guns themselves .",
            "Eventually , Hammer was able to minimize her losses .",
            "Instead of banning assault weapons , the Legislature in June created a commission to study them .",
            "And , instead of enacting a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers , as sought by Handgun Control , it required dealers to make a less-comprehensive background check by telephoning a police computer .",
            "Voters will decide next year whether to accept a three-day waiting period .",
            "Although a Handgun Control news release declared , `` Florida Deals NRA Fourth Loss of Year , '' Hammer was able to say with some justification , `` I think we did pretty good . ''",

            "Over a roast beef sandwich and beer at a plush hotel restaurant , the handsome , 35-year-old former prosecutor was asked whether Barry Goldwater 's assertion that hunters do n't need assault weapons had undermined the NRA 's effort to prevent the ban .",

            "Baker argued that claims of assault-weapon violence are grossly exaggerated and that the Stockton massacre could have been carried out with almost any gun , not just the semiautomatic AK-47 wielded by Patrick Purdy .",
            "A bit more candidly , J. Warren Cassidy , the NRA 's executive vice president , later acknowledged that the Goldwater comment had hurt badly .",

            "Tom Korologos , one of the NRA 's well-connected outside lobbyists , recalled another example of the difficulty of fighting off assault-weapon bans .",

            "It looked for all the world like Rambo 's personal gun . ''",
            "Korologos asked the exhibitor , `` Why are you ruining this perfectly legitimate rifle ? ''",

            "Korologos commented : `` Never mind it does n't do us any good on Capitol Hill to have those damn things loose . ''",
            "An NRA operative conceded that , despite a tough `` no-compromise '' resolution unanimously adopted at the national convention , the NRA might have to back a compromise bill when Congress takes final action on assault weapons .",
            "`` We may be branded as traitors , but that 's the nature of the game in this town , to forge agreements and compromises , '' said the source , who requested anonymity .",
            "Actually , in the face of increasingly well-organized support for gun control , the NRA grudgingly compromised on cop-killer bullets in 1986 and plastic guns in 1988 .",
            "To fight assault-weapon bills , Baker said , the NRA hopes to spend $ 5 million , most of it derived from direct-mail appeals .",
            "The organization 's revenues last year included $ 45.4 million from membership dues and $ 9.4 million from contributions .",
            "About one-fourth of the $ 83.6 million in expenditures was spent on lobbying .",
            "In addition , the NRA is continuing to contribute heavily to political campaigns , despite the disappointments it suffered in last year 's elections .",
            "In 1988 , five incumbents and all 15 challengers supported by the NRA were defeated ; although 182 incumbents won , the NRA netted no gain with the $ 770,000 it poured into campaigns .",
            "For the assault-weapons fight , the NRA has sent dozens of police officers to Washington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs , launched a national newspaper and TV ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a 900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of NRA form letters to President Bush and members of Congress .",
            "Baker denied that NRA officials had anything to do with the petition drive to purge Bush from membership , saying that it originated with rank-and-filers `` obviously disappointed with the President 's first six months in office . ''",
            "But he added that the NRA board of directors would be forced to consider the matter at its September meeting .",
