            "The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around the world , the Survey reported Monday .",

            "Allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps .",
            "Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey 's Earthquake Center said the quake 's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale .",
            "It was centered in the Santa Cruz , Calif. , area , 75 miles south of San Francico .",

            "The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area , which registered a 5.9 Richter reading , Allen said .",
            "`` I think we 'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake , '' he said .",
            "`` What will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved . ''",

            "In addition , some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the Bay Bridge .",
            "In some areas of Southern California , there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring .",
            "The highest , the USGS says , is in the central California town of Parkfield , where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018 ."
