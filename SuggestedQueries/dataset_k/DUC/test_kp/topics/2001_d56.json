            "Further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease , a scientist says .",
            "`` We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be , if not the final cause , at least a major part of the disease process , '' said New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper .",
            "The research `` opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that was n't possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging , '' he said .",
            "Cooper , who has been working with scientists at Oxford University , described the hormone research this week at the 13th International Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney , Australia .",
            "In his presentation , Cooper said the hormone , dubbed `` amylin , '' was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics .",
            "Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity , reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes , he said .",
            "Currently , obesity is considered a major contributor to the disease rather than a result of it .",
            "Insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar .",
            "In Type II diabetes , also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes , the body 's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high .",

            "It often can be controlled through diet and exercise .",
            "Cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin 's secretion or action , opening the possibility of treatment .",
            "He also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetes very early in its development .",
            "The new work is `` a very important finding '' if amylin truly blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics , F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , an authority on Type II diabetes , said Friday .",
            "Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin , but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics , said Pi-Sunyer , director of the endocrinology , diabetes and nutrition division at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York ."

            "Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos , and incidence of the disease increases with age .",
            "In one survey done in San Antonio , a third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes , Davidson said .",
            "Latinos ' higher susceptibility is thought to result from a combination of both heredity and diet .",
            "Similarly , American Indians have the highest diabetes incidence of any ethnic group in the United States .",
            "Genetically controlled defects in the body 's insulin system are also thought to exist both for them and Latinos .",
            "In addition , Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes .",
            "Diabetes that begins in childhood requires daily insulin injections .",
            "Most commonly in Latinos , however , diabetes takes the form called Type II , which first appears in adulthood and often can be controlled with proper diet and exercise .",
            "The disease tends to show up in the late 20s and early 30s among Latinos , a decade earlier than it does in Anglos , Davidson said .",
            "But , because it progresses slowly , Type II diabetes can go undiagnosed for years , allowing complications such as kidney failure , heart disease , blindness and the need for amputation of a foot or toe .",

            "`` In some states like California or Texas , if nothing is done we 're going to pay so much money for health care for people of Latino origin that it may become prohibitive . ''",
            "The number of Latino diabetics in the United States will nearly quadruple by the year 2000 to 8 million , according to projections by Eli Lilly Co. Caring for them will cost more than $ 10 billion a year , even if the disease has no complications , the company projects .",
            "Yet life-style changes today to cut down on obesity can prevent many of those cases from ever occurring , health officials say .",
            "That means adapting an Anglo-oriented health education network to the needs of a diverse Latino community that has a different social structure , health beliefs and eating habits from the majority culture .",
            "For instance , the fact that Type II diabetes frequently shows up in women during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to influence an entire Latino family 's eating habits , said Dr. Martin Montoro , co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center .",
            "Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet , Davidson said .",
            "Recent immigrants and even some longtime U.S. residents are not likely to want to switch completely away from a diet reliant on beans , tortillas and other carbohydrates , Montoro noted , but modifications can be made easily .",
            "One of the most important is to cut down on fat in the diet by eliminating fried foods -- for instance , by not frying tortillas for tacos or enchiladas .",
            "Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle , doctors interested in the issue say .",
            "Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient , said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz , a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical Assn .",
            "Any physician practicing in Southern California needs to be aware of that and to learn to ask more diabetes-related questions of their Latino patients , Lifshitz said .",
            "Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes .",
            "He pointed to the recent indications that Americans ' risk of heart disease is lowering as examples of how educational programs can work .",
            "`` I think that if we give them the opportunity and the tools that Latinos are no different than anybody else , '' Davidson said .",

            "The hormone amylin is normally undetectable but is found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics and appears to be responsible for the obesity , reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes .",

            "Accordingly , diabetes afflicted one in eight Hispanic adults , a rate higher than that of any ethnic group except American Indians .",
            "Diabetes is a defect in the body 's system for using sugar in the blood .",
            "It results from the body 's failure to make insulin .",

            "Researchers started testing an anti-diabetic drug used successfully outside the US , called metaforim , which was expected to have FDA approval .",

            "Examples of how educational programs could work were the indications that Americans ' risk of heart disease was lowering .",
            "In San Jose , California , a free hospital clinic and neighborhood programs were set up for Hispanics to learn how to manage illness .",
            "The focus was on three ways to manage diabetes : diet , exercise and medication .",
            "Participants would learn that traditional dishes could be just as tasty , but healthier , when made with unsaturated fats and that exercise could reduce weight , which in turn would lower the risk of contacting diabetes .",
            "Similarly , health professionals of a Santa Clara Valley Hispanic Program began nutrition and exercise classes in an effort to educate Hispanics on the dangers of diabetes .",
            "Students would be given instructions , geared to Hispanic lifestyle , on cooking with polyunsaturated oil instead of lard and on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise ."
