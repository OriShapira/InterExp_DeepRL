            "Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path , a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru , officials said Monday .",
            "Officials said the capture of Osman Morote , 43 , considered the most radical leader of the movement , was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the Andean highlands in May 1980 .",
            "`` Osman Morote is considered the No .",
            "2 of the party and its military chief , '' the independent magazine Si said recently .",

            "Guzman , Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war , which has claimed more than 10,000 lives .",
            "Guzman has not been seen for years and rumors have circulated that he may have died .",

            "SUMMARY A lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned Shining Path leadership , published recently in a leading opposition newspaper , provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace proposal made by the insurgents last fall .",
            "While the newspaper has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the Shining Path , the paper has also stressed that the peace called for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical retreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not , as President Alberto Fujimori has contended , an implicit admission of defeat .",
            "END SUMMARY Although La Republica , a prominent anti-Fujimori daily , provided little information on the origins of the `` important and unusual '' document that it published in a special 25 January supplement , it assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining the Shining Path 's `` struggle for a peace agreement '' was a genuine Shining Path statement .",
            "The paper claimed that the `` anonymous sources '' who supplied the `` secret '' document provided `` full authentication '' and that `` experts '' consulted by the paper also `` agreed '' that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman ( La Republica , 26 January ) .",
            "( See Note 1 ) ( Note 1 ) La Republica did not assert that the document was actually signed by Guzman .",

            "While the anti-Fujimori daily may have , at least in part , published the document to discredit President Fujimori , it contended that it was motivated by a desire to provide Peruvians with information on the peace proposal that had not been made available by the government .",
            "The paper declared that it was `` clearly '' its `` duty '' to publish the document `` given the mantle of silence that the government has cast '' over the peace negotiations ( 26 January ) .",
            "La Republica 's publication of the Shining Path strategy statement follows by three months the October 1993 release by the Fujimori government of letters from Guzman calling for peace talks with the government ( Radio Programs del Peru , 1 October 1993 ; Radio and TV , 4 October 1993 ; Global de Television , 10 October 1993 ; Panamericana Television , 30 October 1993 ) .",
            "The Shining Path leadership 's sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the government , just as the 31 October national referendum vote was approaching , raised questions in the media about whether the letters really represented authoritative Shining Path policy [ see box ] .",
            "( See Note 2 ) ( Note 2 ) Among other objectives , the narrowly successful referendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second successive term .",
            "Tactical Retreat for Guzman Implicitly rejecting Fujimori 's claim that the Shining Path 's call for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political defeat by the insurgents , La Republica concluded that the movement 's leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than a `` temporary ceasefire '' ( 25 January ) .",
            "( See Note 3 ) According to the daily 's 26 January editorial , the Shining Path tract `` makes it clear '' that in the eyes of Abimael Guzman a `` peace agreement '' is simply an `` armed truce '' until after the year 2OOO , at which time the Shining Path `` would resume its bloodbath . ''",
            "La Republica offered a possible explanation for the insurgents ' tactical retreat in a 3O January interview with a `` military and subversion analyst , '' who suggested-that a temporary withdrawal may offer Guzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political leader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned .",
            "Thee analyst concluded , therefore , that the insurgents ' peace strategy represents `` an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman 's leadership '' and `` recognition that circumstances have changed . ''",
            "( Note 3 ) For example , in his presentation of the video recording of Guzman 's first call for peace talks , Fujimori claimed that the Shining Path `` political '' leadership `` has tacitly admitted that the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the Shining Path '' ( Lima Radio and TV , 4 October 1993 ) .",
            "Outlook La Republica 's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders .",
            "At the same time , however , by concluding that the published strategy statement is merely the Shining Path 's declaration of temporary retreat , the daily has raised new questions about the credibility of Fujimori 's claim that the call for peace represents a victory for the government .",
            "While such doubts are unlikely to seriously affect Fujimori 's prospects for reelection next year , they may have further tarnished the image of the Peruvian president , already damaged by his narrow victory in the constitutional referendum last October .",
            "BOX Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks , announced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October ( Radio Programas del Peru , 1 October 1993 ) , the conservative daily El Comercio reported that one seasoned political observer had warned '' that Guzman 's `` reported '' desire `` to reach a peace agreement '' does not mean there is reason `` to claim a victory in the ongoing struggle against terrorism '' since , according to the observer , the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control the Shining Path ( 2 October 1993 ) .",
            "-- Following the second Guzman letter , which supplemented the call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori 's economic and political program ( Lima Global de Television , 1O October 1993 ) , a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas wrote that the government was using a `` broken '' Guzman `` in the campaign for the 'yes ' vote '' for the upcoming referendum , adding that `` it is no coincidence that the letters ... have come out during the 3O days prior '' to the 31 October vote ( 14 October 1993 ) .",
            "-- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter , an editorial in La Republica wondered whether `` government representatives , '' working to promote the `` yes '' vote on the referendum , had not `` fallen into a trap '' by thinking that Shining Path militants would take seriously such an `` unctuous '' call for peace talks as appeared in the letter ( 14 October 1993 ) .",
            "-- Also in response to the second letter , Caretas on 14 October claimed that Fujimori was `` using '' Guzman `` in the campaign '' to win the 31 October referendum , noting that `` with Guzman 's letters '' calling for peace talks , Fujimori 's `` promise '' to wipe out the Shining Path by 1995 `` may gain credibility .

            "`` Comrade Feliciano . ''",
            "During the meeting , the Shining Path Central Committee decided to continue the `` people 's war '' and to consider those members who uphold the peace accord with the government to be removed from the party `` by their own free will . ''",
            "The document entitled `` To Grow Strong on the Grounds of Partisan Unity and Conquer Power '' [ Reafirmarse en la Base de Unidad Partidaria y Construir la Conquesta del Power ] , which contains the conclusions of the Shining Path event , criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating to `` uphold the great decision and definition , '' that is , Abimael Guzman 's appeal for the Shining Path to end hostilities against the Peruvian state .",
            "A Shining Path pamphlet dated February , which is signed by the leaders under arrest , asserts that `` the people 's war has ended , and ( therefore ) to continue refusing to uphold ( the `` great decision and definition '' ) means obstructing the Peace Accord and placing the life of President Gonzalo and other comrades at stake . ''",
            "But the Central Committee meeting in February disqualified the arrested leaders , stating that `` it is an international communist rule that no leader can lead ( the party or a war ) from prison . ''",
            "According to the Maoist theory , a militant who is in prison loses his operational capacity when he is isolated from reality , and therefore is assigned another type of job .",
            "In March , the National Counterterrorism Directorate [ Dincote ] learned about the Shining Path meeting , according to an intelligence report datelined 31 March that states it was held in Razuhuillca , Huanta Province , Ayacucho .",
            "As a result , Peruvian Air Force troops carried out operations in the aforementioned area during the second week of April .",
            "The operations , however , were unproductive .",

            "The five-point document issued at the end of the meeting is attached to lengthy citations of speeches by Abimael Guzman and documents signed by him that show why the war must not end .",
            "The following is one of the citations chosen by the Shining Path Central Committee to uphold its decisions : `` Always taking into account the glorious actions of the people 's war , the people 's war can not end .",

            "This was selected from the document entitled `` To Conquer Power in the Midst of the People 's War '' that was drafted during the Second Shining Path Central Committee Plenum , when Guzman was still free .",
            "The document even mentions what must be done with those who uphold peace and put down arms : `` There are two reasons for surrendering : to surrender in view of local reaction and to surrender in view of international reaction .",
            "This is always the case .",
            "Its purpose is to ruin the revolution .",
            "Those who surrender , therefore , are no good , and must be wiped out through fire and bloodshed . ''",

            "The first of the five points discussed during the meeting refers to `` reasserting '' the agreements reached during the Third Central Committee Plenum , which was held in March 1992 and headed by Abimael Guzman Reinoso .",
            "This plenum was labeled `` glorious , historic , and momentous '' as it planned the terrible wave of violence unleashed by the Shining Path in July 1992 .",
            "During the 1992 partisan meeting , it was stated that during an adverse situation the party should draft `` a new plan , taking into account the experience of the past years , establish new axes , sub-axes , guidelines , and lines of action with a nationwide criteria ( ... ) , seek new ways to develop and set up strategic military plans , and establish , for example , those objectives and carry them out on an established date .

            "It seems that the Third Central Committee Plenum 's assessment of what was happening to the Shining Path was negative and , therefore , it was decided to unleash a fierce wave of violence in order to conceal the weaknesses of the Maoist organization .",

            "During the working meeting , and in addition to approving the efforts to `` step up investigations to determine the sanctions for those who are found responsible '' for contributing to the arrest of Abimael Guzman , it was agreed , among other issues : 1 .",
            "To defend the life of `` President Gonzalo '' by widely preaching our ideology , by showing great courage , placing even our lives at stake , by keeping our red and invincible flag flying high , and by pursuing our unwavering objective : communism . ''",

            "Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working Meeting , the Central Committee , during the meeting in February presided over by `` Feliciano , '' reasserted `` the principle of revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the people 's war . ''",
            "The third point discussed during the Central Committee meeting headed by `` Feliciano '' referred to the militants who uphold the peace accord .",
            "The document addresses this aspect of the internal debate as : `` About the Struggle Against the Counterrevolutionary Hoax and the Black Group that upholds a Right-Wing Opportunist Line ( LOD ) . ''",
            "In order to confront the Black Group or LOD , which are nothing but Shining Path militants who sign Abimael Guzman 's letters and uphold his `` great decision and definition '' to negotiate with the government in order to end the war , the Central Committee demands that the militants `` grow stronger on the Basis for Partisan Unity [ Base de Unidad Partidaria , BUP ] , '' which is the Shining Path basic principles adopted during the 1988 Congress , and `` arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people 's war . ''",
            "The Central Committee Plenum that `` Feliciano '' presided over in order to break away from the Black Group orders the `` unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the BUP throughout the party , the People 's Liberation Army , and among the masses of the New Power . ''",
            "The Central Committee uses several arguments to `` urge the smashing of the counterrevolutionary nonsense and the misbegotten schemes of Yankee imperialism , the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship , and the Black Group : '' 1 .",
            "The agreements reached at the Third Plenum ( March 1992 ) and the working meeting ( August 1993 ) must be ratified because `` facts have confirmed that the position established on those occasions toward the counterrevolutionary scheme was right and proper . ''",

            "It added : `` The short-term objective of this scheme is to win the elections , prevent the commemoration of ( Mao 's ) centennial in December 1994 , and cover up the La Cantuta affair , but the final goal is to annihilate the people 's war and move ahead with their plan to murder President Gonzalo . ''",
            "The Central Committee does acknowledge Guzman as its leader , and gives him credit for the ideology he devised , the so-called `` Gonzalo 's Thoughts , '' but now he is considered to be a merely decorative figure because neither the party nor the war can be led from a cell , especially when the leader is kept incommunicado and his contacts with the outside world must go through government officials .",
            "3 .",
            "The Black Group is made up of `` infiltrators , traitors , weaklings , and old revisionists , linked directly to reactionaries , '' meaning Osman Morote , Elena Iparraguire , Maria Pantoja , Martha Huatay , Edmundo Cox , and others who are in touch with government representatives and prison officials .",
            "4 .",
            "The activities of the Black Group `` go against the conclusions of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist-Gonzalo 's Thoughts First Congress ( 1988 ) , the BUP , the leadership , the party , and the people 's war , which means that its members have voluntarily strayed from the party . ''",
            "This clearly means that the negotiators of the peace agreement no longer belong to the Shining Path because their actions openly violate the agreements , resolutions , and decisions reached at party meetings such as the Third Plenum and the Working Meeting .",

''",
            "The Central Committee meeting that `` Feliciano '' presided over clearly defined its position toward Abimael Guzman Reinoso , whose ideological contribution to the people 's war , called `` Gonzalo 's Thoughts , '' was acknowledged .",
            "Gonzalo 's `` leadership '' was also accepted but , as he is operationally restricted , he can not lead the party anymore .",
            "Guzman and the leaders who support his decision to hold talks with the administration signed a communique that was released in March .",
            "This communique `` warned against '' and `` denounced '' the reports of `` Feliciano 's '' Central Committee , which decided to go on with the war .",
            "This communique stated : `` They are trying to separate ` Gonzalo 's Thoughts ' from ` President Gonzalo ' the person .",
            "Under the guise of defending the party , they are undermining it and its leadership so as to bring about its defeat , by using empty rhetoric to disguise their partisan , opportunistic , and personal interests and ambitions , and by taking a blind , biased , subjective , and superficial approach to concrete reality .",
            "( ... ) We urge the eradication of these leftist ideas of military extraction . ''",
            "The communique emphasized the decision to put an end to the people 's war : `` The people 's war is over .",
            "To continue it means sabotaging the peace agreement .",
            "We warn our members against militaristic and revisionist approaches , and urge them to keep their eyes open to unmask this or any other scheme . ''",
            "Guzman 's call upon the militants in action to `` abide '' by the decision to hold talks with the administration in order to stop the war , and to fight those who disagree with this decision , is persistent : `` Once again we warn the militants to be on guard against any desperate action , adventure , or provocation from third parties , because the goal of all this is to scuttle the proposed peace agreement .",
            "Such actions must be prevented to the extent possible , and immediately and categorically criticized . ''",
            "Meanwhile , the Central Committee has acknowledged `` Gonzalo 's Thoughts '' as the ideological basis for the `` people 's war , '' Guzman Reinoso 's `` leadership '' and his inability to lead the party and the war from prison , and has decided to reorganize the Shining Path machine to launch a new stage of the war without Guzman .",
            "The Dincote report lists the steps that `` Feliciano 's '' followers are taking to carry out actions that would put Shining Path back in the political picture .",
            "The report states that the Shining Path is expected `` to carry out isolated actions at key targets in order to demonstrate its operational capacity . ''",
            "Intelligence agents believe that the most likely targets are `` financial companies , banks , stores , and industries , in order to sow confusion among local and foreign investors . ''",
            "Other likely targets are `` soon-to-be-privatized public energy and mining companies , the embassies of countries whose citizens are purchasing Peruvian companies , and the interests that these countries already have in Peru .",
            "Government politicians and high-ranking members of the forces of order are also among the main targets .",
            "In this case the objective is to obtain the freedom of Abimael Guzman Reinoso . ''",
            "The counterterrorism police believe that the Shining Path `` urgently needs to demonstrate its power in order to get out of its current defensive position . ''",
            "Dincote 's intelligence reports adds that the internal strife in the Shining Path has reached the level of killings among militants , so it is likely that there will be a `` settling of accounts . ''",
            "Shining Path members believe that surrender deserves capital punishment .",
            "The Dincote report , which confirmed that `` Feliciano '' presided over a Shining Path Central Committee meeting somewhere in Razuillca , added that it has been decided to `` rescue Abimael Guzman Reinoso , dead or alive . ''",
            "The report explains that `` Israeli experts in hostage rescue and underwater operations ( demolition ) have been hired for this purpose . ''",

            "The police had discovered the house in one of Lima 's affluent neighborhoods just two days earlier .",
            "This was the underground organization 's central nervous system , commented investigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca , a short man who is a consummate bureaucratic survivor .",
            "Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to put Shining Path watchers ( such as myself ) out of business .",
            "Alas , as it turned out this was not the rebel organization 's headquarters , nor its central nervous system , but more of an archive and memorabilia repository .",
            "Nevertheless , it was a very important and unexpected police coup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have brought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not decided to make public the operation so soon after the first police intervention , in order to score a quick propaganda gain .",
            "This impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas ' entire clandestine apparatus , allowing them to limit considerably the damage inflicted on them .",
            "As Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru 's next president on July 28 , the question of whether the Shining Path will hound his administration as it has the previous two ranks high among his concerns .",
            "Among Shining Path watchers ( `` Senderlogos '' ) there is strong disagreement on fundamentals : Is the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker ?",
            "Is it making progress or losing ground among the population ?",
            "And finally , who is actually winning the war ?",
            "There are no easy answers .",
            "There is not much of a dispute on the basic data , however .",
            "The Shining Path went to war in 1980 , on the same day Peru was holding general elections after 12 years of a military dictatorship .",
            "Its first actions were cautious , modest and often ludicrous in a crazy way ( like hanging dogs from lampposts , with scribbled insults over them to Chinese Communist martyrs ) .",
            "But the actions intensified and soon became quite lethal .",
            "While President Fernando Belaunde 's regime did what it could to maintain democratic legality at first , it was quite unprepared to deal with any insurgency -- especially with one that had been meticulously planned and organized several years before the first shot was fired .",
            "In October 1981 , emergency laws were imposed for the first time on part of Peru ; they covered only 2 % of the population .",
            "Now about 50 % of all Peruvians live under emergency law .",

            "If the armed forces have been rightly accused of systematic violations of human rights ( Peru ranks as one of the world 's worst human-rights offenders ) , the military faults the civilian authorities for failing to provide much-needed leadership .",
            "Mr. Belaunde ( the first to deal with the problem ) , who tried to ignore the insurgency out of existence , is regarded as a well-meaning but inept leader .",
            "There are no kind words for Mr. Garcia , on the other hand .",
            "In the first weeks of his mandate , he made several right moves -- like emphasizing his role as commander in chief of the armed forces and reorganizing the corruption-ridden police .",
            "But things began to unravel soon after .",
            "At first , he tried a liberal approach , looking for a dialogue with the fanatical Shining Path , and sending scores of young professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said were the `` root causes '' of the insurgency .",
            "But dialogue was disdainfully rejected : Dozens of these professionals were assassinated , and the armed forces slowed down their actions , while the rebels made largely unimpeded progress .",
            "Then , Mr. Garcia tried a tougher approach , and human-rights violations surged to their current level .",
            "And for the first time , death squads -- linked by some analysts to Mr. Garcia 's APRA Party -- began to contribute to the killing .",
            "Midpoint during his term , Mr. Garcia lost all hope of defeating the Shining Path , and decided just to coexist with it , says Rafael Merino , a respected analyst on security matters .",
            "Not even in that was Mr. Garcia successful , as violence climbed steadily during the second half of his term .",
            "In 1988 , 1,986 people were killed as a result of insurgent or counterinsurgent actions ; in 1989 , 3,198 were killed ; and 1,730 during the first six months of 1990 .",
            "How well is Mr. Fujimori expected to deal with the insurgency ?",
            "His campaign pitch advocated an approach closely resembling that of Mr. Garcia 's first year .",
            "According to Francisco Loayza , Mr. Fujimori 's adviser on internal-security matters , military actions against the Shining Path should be subordinated to economic-development initiatives .",
            "`` { The military } should mainly provide security for development projects , '' Mr. Loayza says .",
            "He stressed that the main thrust of Mr. Fujimori 's `` pacification '' policies would be to address the `` structural violence { read : social injustice } that makes subversion possible . ''",
            "Mr. Loayza says that President Garcia 's approach failed because of corruption and ineptitude .",
            "He also feels that the Shining Path is weakened , and that an important Shining Path faction would be willing to engage in peace talks .",
            "This is only wishful thinking , according to Mr. Merino : `` If President Fujimori thinks he 'll finish the war through those ` pacification ' policies , it will be like riding into battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo . ''",
            "Actually , Mr. Fujimori might end up implementing internal war policies that would be quite different from those advocated during his campaign .",
            "At least , that 's what seems is going to happen with the economy , where the vote-getting populist message appears in the process of being replaced by a far more orthodox approach .",
            "Free-market economist Hernando de Soto , who has been advising Mr. Fujimori during the past month , thinks that might be the case .",
            "`` He learns fast , '' Mr. de Soto told me recently , `` and he has all the right instincts . ''",
            "Even if Mr. Fujimori proves to be a quick learner , he will have his work cut out for him .",

            "This was evident when walking through their safe house in Lima .",
