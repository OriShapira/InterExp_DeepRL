            "The disclosure comes just a couple days after the chairman of EgyptAir told a news conference in Cairo that `` something happened '' to the tail of the Boeing 767 that caused it to go into a near supersonic dive before the plane broke up and crashed into the sea .",
            "Safety board chairman Jim Hall said investigators from his agency and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority will examine the 767 's elevator system , as well as perform a metallurgic examination of the plane 's engine pylon components .",
            "The elevators are flat panels on the horizontal stabalizer of the tail that control up and down movements of the plane when the pilot pushes or pulls on the control stick .",
            "Hall 's statement did not suggest that investigators suspect the elevator system played a role in the crash , and a Boeing spokesman said such a review is typical in airline crash investigations .",
            "`` The safety board is going through a deliberate and methodical process as they do on all their investigations , and Boeing continues to support the investigation , '' said Boeing safety spokesman John Dern .",
            "There have been no reports of problems with the 767 's elevator system or the engine pylons , Dern said .",

            "Investigators have found nothing in an analysis of the cockpit voice recorder that would point toward a bomb or a mechanical problem as the cause of its crash .",
            "Radio communication between the flight crew and air traffic controllers was routine , and at no time did a member of the crew advise controllers of either an emergency or a mechanical problem or concern .",
            "In addition , the plane 's other black box , the flight data recorder , does not indicate there was an explosion or mechanical problem .",
            "That points to another cause , and the leading theory is that the plane was brought down by a deliberate act of the backup copilot .",
            "In his statement Friday , Hall blasted as `` wrong '' a published report this week that quoted unnamed government officials as saying a mechanical problem has all but been ruled out as the cause of the crash .",
            "`` NTSB is disturbed to see that again this week unidentified sources were used as the basis of a news report purporting to have informed knowledge of our work , '' Hall said in a statement released late Friday afternoon .",

            "No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted , and the activities that I have outlined indicate that there is much that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be reached . ''",

            "Since then , the safety board has said little about how the investigation is going .",
            "Hall said substantial portions of the wings , tail , fuselage and an engine had been recovered .",

            "NEWPORT NAVAL STATION , R.I. _ A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday , bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea .",
            "The container that held the recorder , known as a black box , showed signs of damage when it was recovered , but the flight recorder inside seemed to have survived the jetliner 's catastrophic impact and nine days of submersion in salt water , investigators said .",
            "`` The magnetic tape was removed from its protective casing , cleaned and dried , '' James E. Hall , chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board , said Tuesday night after investigators in Washington began evaluating the recorder 's condition .",
            "`` The tape has data on it , and NTSB engineers are currently working to extract information . ''",
            "The recovery of the box , and the condition of its contents , appears to have provided the first breaks in what has been a frustrating case .",
            "For much of the past week , investigators and mourning families have waited as foul weather and winds caused delays in the search for the recorders .",
            "Preliminary radar data has shown that the plane fell precipitously , and three lobstermen reported hearing a strange rumble where the plane slammed into the ocean 's surface .",
            "But until the recovery of the data recorder on Tuesday , virtually no other information had been available .",
            "EgyptAir 's pilots reported no trouble over their radios before or during the dive , and the wreckage recovered to date has revealed little more than that the great airplane _ a Boeing 767 with a wingspan of 156 feet and a length of 176 feet _ was reduced to bits when it struck the sea .",
            "The crash killed all 217 passengers and crewmen .",
            "Hall said the retrieval of the first recorder _ another , the cockpit voice recorder , remains missing on the sea floor _ could provide key insights into the crash .",
            "`` In any investigation , the most important information comes from the recorders , '' Hall said .",
            "`` They can save several steps in the investigatory process . ''",
            "The cockpit voice recorder is designed to preserve conversations among the pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit , including the noise from plane alarms , its two engines , or any obvious mechanical problems .",
            "The flight data recorder is designed to record more than 150 categories of information that shows how the plane was flying , how the pilots were handling it and how the aircraft 's systems were operating .",
            "Hall said he hopes the recorder `` will paint a picture of what this airplane was doing in its last minutes , and seconds , before this tragedy occurred . ''",
            "The black box was discovered before dawn in 245 feet of water by the Deep Drone , a robot submarine that was deployed and controlled from the Grapple , a Navy salvage ship .",
            "The Deep Drone had resumed searching after a more capable robot , known as Magnum and deployed from the submarine support vessel Carolyn Chouest , damaged its fiber optic cable on undersea wreckage .",
            "Within hours of lifting the black box aboard the Grapple , the Navy flew it by helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland , where it was transferred to Washington .",
            "Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , who are treating all debris recovered from the aircraft as potential criminal evidence even though the investigation has turned up no indication that the plane was brought down by a crime or terrorism , accompanied the recorder on its trip .",
            "The Navy , working in moderate seas of 5 to 7 feet , planned to continue searching for the remaining black box through the night and into Wednesday morning .",
            "Retrieving the second recorder is important because in some past jetliner accidents , information from the two flight recorders , together , has provided a level of detail that has enabled investigators to pinpoint causes .",
            "For example , when an Aeroperu Boeing 757 crashed soon after takeoff from Lima in 1996 , the cockpit voice recorder captured the desperate conversation of the two pilots .",
            "`` Everything has gone , all the instruments went to ( expletive ) , '' the captain said , as the plane dropped into the Pacific .",
            "The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane , known as static ports , which are used to measure air pressure and determine air speed .",
            "The static ports are crucial because speed can not be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at night , and if a plane flies too fast or too slow , it will crash .",
            "Investigators , zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing the two flight recorders , eventually found that maintenance workers had covered the 757 's static ports with protective masking tape when they washed the plane , and had neglected to remove it _ an oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from the instruments and flew the plane to its doom .",
            "In some cases , however , flight recorders have proved insufficient .",
            "In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia last year , the recorders have provided no insight into the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air traffic controllers on the ground ."

            "It is not yet clear whether the autopilot disconnected by itself or was turned off by the crew of the Cairo-bound jet that was some 40 minutes out of New York 's Kennedy Airport at the time .",
            "National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall , releasing the first tidbits of information that his investigators have gleaned from examining one of the jet 's two black boxes , said the Boeing 767 made what appears to be a `` controlled descent '' from 33,000 feet down to 19,000 feet .",
            "The flight data recorder stopped shortly afterward and the final five to 10 seconds of information on its tape are still being analyzed , Hall told a news conference at the safety board 's headquarters in Washington , D.C. All aboard the jet died when it crashed into the Atlantic less than two minutes after the autopilot disconnected ..",
            "Although the information made public so far raises still more questions about what could have gone wrong on Flight 990 , Hall did say investigators do not believe the jet 's thrust reversers deployed in flight .",
            "One of the thrust reversers on the twin-engine 767 , which are used to slow a jet after landing , had been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for New York , and there has been speculation that perhaps a thrust reverser deployed during flight .",
            "That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed in flight .",
            "The Lauda Air crash killed all 223 people on board .",
            "`` There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have , '' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990 .",

            "It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet 's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight , and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash .",
            "A former 767 pilot told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last night the jet may have experienced an in-flight electrical or computer problem , based on the limited amount of information made public so far by the safety board .",
            "The autopilot on a 767 would disconnect from flying the airplane if there there were a problem with the cockpit computers or the plane 's electrical system , said Dan Gellert of Sequim , a former pilot with Eastern Airlines who later trained 767 pilots .",
            "A light would flash and an alarm would sound to let the crew know immediately that the autopilot was off , he said .",
            "The 767 has a modern `` glass cockpit , '' and information about the plane , including its altitude and attitude ( or angle of flight ) , are displayed on screens in front of the crew .",
            "An electrical or computer problem would cause those screens to go blank , or could even result in erroneous flight data to be displayed , Gellert said .",
            "The pilots , believing they were still in level flight , could have put the big jet into a dive , he theorized .",
            "An electrical problem would also explain why the plane 's transponder stopped working , he said .",

            "Until Wednesday , the only information about what happened to EgyptAir Flight 990 had come from an analysis of radar data by the NTSB and the Air Force .",
            "Safety board investigators said last week the radar analysis showed the jet , flying at 33,000 feet , suddenly entered a steep but straight dive down to 16,700 feet .",
            "At that point , air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane 's transponder .",
            "But Air Force radar continued to plot the plane 's course and altitude down to 16,000 feet .",
            "The jet climbed back to 24,000 feet before making a rapid descent to 10,000 feet .",
            "At that point , radar showed multiple targets , indicating the plane broke up before it hit the ocean .",
            "The transponder operates on a separate electrical buss , or pathway , from the plane 's computers and autopilot , Gellert said .",
            "That would explain why it kept working longer , assuming an electrical problem caused the autopilot to disconnect .",
            "Based on preliminary analysis , investigators had said last week that early in its 17,000-foot dive , the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound , though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet .",
            "But Hall said Wednesday the flight data recorder indicates the plane did not reach such speeds .",
            "Even so , the 767 did dive much faster than it would have in an emergency .",
            "Based on the radar analysis , the jet took 40 second to reach 16,700 feet , which would have meant it was going down at more than 24,000 feet per minute .",
            "A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute .",
            "An emergency descent , for example , might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible .",
            "Gellert said pilots are trained to bank a commercial jetliner about 30 degree before making an emergency descent .",
            "That is to keep the passengers from flying out of their seats in a steep dive .",
            "Centrifugal force during the turn presses passengers into their seats .",
            "Investigators have said the radar data shows the plane did not turn in its initial dive .",
            "Neither the pilot nor co-pilot of EgyptAir Flight 990 radioed any kind of distress call to air traffic controllers .",
            "Their last contact with controllers a few minutes before the plane began its descent did not indicate any problem .",
            "Gellert said an electrical problem could have knocked out communications , or the crew might have been preoccupied trying to regain control of their airplane .",
            "Hall did not comment Wednesday on how the airplane behaved after the brief climb shown by radar data , or in its final plunge to the ocean .",

            "Three government officials close to the investigation , speaking on condition of anonymity , said examinations of the jet 's remains have revealed no signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash , AP reported Thursday .",
