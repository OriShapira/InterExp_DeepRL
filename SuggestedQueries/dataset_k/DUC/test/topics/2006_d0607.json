            "& LR ; WASHINGTON _ One year after saying China had improved its human rights record , the Clinton administration on Friday issued one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described some of the most serious human rights violations in a decade .",
            "Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright 's departure for China , at a time when President Clinton has been criticized for being too easy on the government in Beijing , the State Department 's annual report on rights said that the country 's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere to international human rights conventions and instead decided last fall `` to nip in the bud '' attempts to form independent democratic parties .",
            "The government also imprisoned several thousand political and religious dissidents , tortured prisoners , suppressed Chinese of minority faiths , especially Christians , and imposed new restrictions on the press , including the Internet , according to the report .",
            "Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan , the human rights document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the effectiveness of the administration 's policies of engagement with China .",
            "Last year 's rather mild description of China 's human rights policies provoked criticism that the administration was overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the issue as an obstacle to trade .",
            "Sen. Paul Wellstone , D-Minn. , said , `` There is a considerable indignation about the Chinese government 's renewed human rights abuses , its proliferation of military technology and its threats to its neighbors . ''",
            "On Thursday , the Senate unanimously passed a resolution co-sponsored by Wellstone and Sen. Tim Hutchinson , R-Ark. , asking the administration to condemn China 's human rights record at an upcoming U.N. meeting in Geneva .",
            "`` What 's the hesitation of following up on this strong report with a strong condemnation _ unless commercial interests trump all other interests in this administration , '' Wellstone said .",
            "The Clinton administration is unlikely to go along with that suggestion .",
            "In a speech in San Francisco on Friday , President Clinton defended his administration 's policy of engagement with China and suggested China was `` moving away from the rule of fear , ' even though it was `` not yet rooted in the rule of law . ''",
            "Still , administration officials are worried that China is becoming a tinderbox .",
            "`` There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting very nervous about dissidents and the opposition , '' said a senior official in the Clinton administration .",
            "In presenting the report , Harold Hongju Koh , assistant secretary of state for democracy , human rights and labor , said Ms. Albright would discuss the report 's finding with Chinese leaders when she travels there this weekend but cautioned that even the most `` robust '' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in Chinese behavior .",
            "`` I think it 's a mistake to conclude that the human rights in China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is , '' Koh said .",
            "`` The question here is , how can developments within China , which have led to greater economic freedom , and efforts at legal reform , which could bring about sweeping change , be pressed and pushed through a process of engagement ? ''",
            "There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the State Department report .",
            "( STORY CAN END HERE .",
            "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) Clinton administration officials , scholars and leaders of human rights groups all agree that underlying the Chinese government 's fears about social unrest is the downturn in the country 's economy .",
            "China 's annual double-digit economic growth is a thing of the past , and Chinese leaders are worried that the growing ranks of the unemployed will join forces with political dissidents and angry farmers and create a situation beyond their control .",
            "`` They have n't had the growth they need to continue with their economic reforms , '' said a senior administration official involved in China policy .",
            "`` Their economy is flat .",
            "Exports are flat and there is a real increase in labor unrest .",
            "That 's why the regime is very very anxious about political unrest . ''",
            "The report gave China high marks for continuing to open up the economy and thereby opening up society .",
            "`` Over all , average citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom than ever before : higher disposable income , looser economic controls , greater freedom of movement , increased access to outside sources of information , greater room for individual choice , and more diversity in cultural life , '' it said .",
            "But it went on to say that economic reform has not brought political freedom and that Chinese who try to dissent `` live in an environment filled with repression . ''",
            "Edward Friedman , a China scholar at the University of Wisconsin , said , `` The hard-liners in the Chinese government are increasingly in control and the economic liberalizers have to be more circumspect . ''",
            "In recent years the Chinese earned praise from the administration for signing two major international conventions on economic , cultural , civil and political rights that include guarantees of the freedom of association , speech , assembly and religion .",
            "China 's leaders have said they would respect the spirit of the law until the national legislature ratified the treaties , a promise they broke with this year 's violations .",
            "`` There has been a complete disparity in the commitments China has made by signing the various treaties and their practice of flagrantly violating their citizens ' rights , '' said Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch .",
            "The Pentagon 's report to Congress on the military balance between China and Taiwan highlighted how Beijing 's deployment of short range missiles aimed at the Taiwan Straits was meant to intimidate and threaten Taiwan .",
            "While the report said there have been no recent increases in the number of missiles targeted at Taiwan in the past year , it added that China 's plans to increase its cruise and ballistic missiles to attain an `` overwhelming advantage '' over Taiwan by the year 2005 .",
            "Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as well as tensions between China and its southeast Asian neighbors over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the overall deterioration in relations between China and the United States .",
            "Those issues , as well as the ongoing repression in Tibet , will be discussed by Ms. Albright in China next week in preparation for the visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in April .",
            "Moreover , in the coming months a series of anniversaries in China could spark unrest that might further test the leadership 's tolerance of dissent .",
            "June 4 is the 10th anniversary of the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing , and on Oct. 1 the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China .",
            "`` China as well as the Chinese are very anniversary conscious , and the leaders will definitely want to avoid unofficial demonstrations , '' Jendrzejczyk said .",

            "The expansion of the People 's Armed Police , a national force trained in riot control , reflects the leaders ' growing preoccupation with domestic unrest .",
            "It also reflects their wish to avoid having to resort to army combat troops to quell popular demonstrations , as occurred in 1989 around Tiananmen Square with disastrously bloody results .",
            "Over the last year , according to witnesses and other accounts , armed police units were called out to help the ordinary police contain many of the hundreds of demonstrations and protests reported around China .",
            "The armed police have also battled ethnic separatists in the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang , and have long been used to help control Tibet .",
            "The protests bubbling up around China , almost always centered on economic complaints , have generally been small , and dispersed peacefully .",

            "The expansion and upgrading of the force accelerated after 1989 , when it may have numbered about 600,000 .",
            "That year , the armed police 's failure to disperse student demonstrators in Beijing forced the leaders to call in combat units , which killed hundreds of civilians and did lasting damage to China 's image as well as to army morale .",

            "The expansion of the armed police may also give Jiang , who had no military experience , an important personal base of power , outside experts believe .",
            "Deployments of the armed police to quell unrest are rarely announced , but there is evidence that they have been in action numerous times around China in the past year .",

            "But the ferocity of Beijing 's campaign , aimed at a group of mainly middle-aged people who practice a form of Chinese breathing exercises and meditation , suggests that it regards Falun Gong as more than a movement of physical and moral uplift .",
            "At a time when China 's economy is slowing and social unrest is rising , officials here view this amorphous but fast-growing sect as a dangerous political force .",
            "After Beijing handed down its edict Thursday afternoon , it began an extraordinary public-relations assault on the group and its founder , Li Hongzhi , through state-run television and newspapers .",
            "The Ministry of Civil Affairs accused Falun Gong of `` inciting and creating disturbances , and jeopardizing social stability . ''",
            "In an editorial scheduled for publication on Friday , the Communist Party newspaper People 's Daily said Li was pursuing a hidden political agenda that posed a `` massive threat '' to Chinese society .",
            "State media also accused Li of misleading followers about his birth date , so that he could claim to be a reincarnation of Sakyamuni , the founder of Buddhism and of accepting payments for supposedly miraculous cures .",
            "Li , 48 , a former grain bureau clerk who left China for the United States last year , fashioned his sect from an eclectic blend of traditional breathing exercises , as well as elements of Buddhism and Taoism .",
            "His followers say they disavow politics and embrace Li 's teachings for their physical and spiritual health .",
            "But Falun Gong deeply unsettled China 's rulers when 10,000 of its adherents materialized on April 25 in front of the compound that houses President Jiang Zemin and other leaders .",
            "The rally , held to demand official recognition for the group , demonstrated that this obscure spiritual sect was in fact a highly organized movement with an international network capable of mobilizing thousands of people and putting them under the noses of China 's top leaders without a whisper of warning .",
            "As word of the detentions spread this week , thousands of Falun Gong followers massed in front of government offices in Dalian , Guangzhou and 28 other cities to protest the government 's crackdown , according to members of the group and a human rights organization in Hong Kong .",
            "The wall-to-wall coverage of the ban in the state-run media underscores that the government is determined to stamp out Falun Gong .",
            "But with a large and rapidly growing membership _ estimates range from the government 's figure of 2 million to the group 's claim of 100 million followers worldwide _ a fluid structure , and an appreciation of the power of the Internet to pass information , Falun Gong could prove an elusive quarry for Beijing .",
            "`` I think this is going to make us stronger , '' said Sophie Xiao , a spokeswoman for Falun Gong in Hong Kong .",
            "`` People are not simple-minded .",
            "Educated people will hear about this group and check it out . ''",
            "There were no reports of protests following Thursday 's announcement .",
            "Late Thursday afternoon , hundreds of police and troops still circled Zhongnanhai , the leaders ' compound , which has been a fortress since the crackdown began on Monday night .",
            "The police continued to stop traffic on the western edge of the complex , where Falun Gong members held their rally in April .",
            "A former Chinese official said police in Beijing had released several hundred people _ most of them women _ who had been detained as they massed near Zhongnanhai on Tuesday and Wednesday .",
            "Chinese officials were clearly concerned about how the ban would be received abroad .",
            "Shortly before the announcement was made public , a high-ranking government official briefed foreign correspondents here on why the government felt it necessary to take such Draconian action .",
            "The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Beijing had moved against Falun Gong because of `` the danger it posed to our country and our people .",
            "Any responsible government would do the same . ''",
            "He said members of the group had harassed government offices and pro-Beijing news organizations .",
            "And he said the government had evidence that Li had been in Beijing for the three days prior to the April rally in front of Zhongnanhai .",
            "Li , he said , had been instrumental in planning it .",
            "The strident tone and sheer volume of the denunciations of Falun Gong baffled some experts in Chinese politics .",
            "Why , they asked , would the government pour so much energy into fighting a group which , by its estimates , has 2 million members _ far fewer than the 100 million the group claims ?",
            "`` After all , a few months ago hardly anyone had heard of it , and no one was saying it was a threat to the state , '' said one political scholar in Beijing , who spoke on condition of anonymity .",
            "`` I think the party leaders felt personally insulted by the Falun Gong protest .",

            "Experts said there were plenty of reasons for Beijing to worry about this kind of group .",
            "With its mixture of martial arts and mysticism , Falun Gong appeals to people who have felt adrift since Deng Xioaping began reforming the Chinese economy and relaxing social controls in 1979 .",
            "Popular groups like Falun Gong played a profoundly disruptive role in the final decades of the last imperial dynasty .",
