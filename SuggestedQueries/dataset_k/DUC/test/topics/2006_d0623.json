            "TRENTON , N.J. ( AP ) - A handful of New Jersey towns considering developing local smoking bans may have second thoughts after last week 's court ruling striking down Princeton 's broad anti-smoking ordinance .",
            "''It will certainly put a damper on and intimidate the ( communities considering new local smoking restrictions ) from moving ahead , '' Regina Carlson , executive director of the anti-smoking nonprofit New Jersey GASP , told The Times of Trenton for Monday 's editions .",
            "Bans are in place already in several towns , but none of the existing anti-smoking ordinances are as sweeping as the one in Princeton , which would have been the strictest in the state .",
            "It prohibited lighting up in bars , restaurants and workplaces , restricting smoking to homes , cigar shops or outdoors .",

            "WASHINGTON _ A week after Senate Republicans killed sweeping anti-smoking legislation , House GOP leaders on Thursday outlined a scaled-down bill to persuade teens not to smoke and urge states to lift the driving licenses of teens who do .",
            "Rep. Deborah Pryce , R-Ohio , who headed a House Republican task force that drafted the outline , provided few details about how the plan would work , saying that no decisions have been made about how much it would cost or who would pay for it .",
            "She said detailed legislation would be written by committee chairmen over the July 4th recess , which begins Friday and ends in mid-July .",
            "The GOP leadership outline urges states to enact laws penalizing minors who smoke by suspending their drivers ' licenses and requiring them to perform community service .",
            "The plan was vague about the future powers of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco , though it specifically urged that the FDA have the power to regulate cigarette manufacturing .",
            "The outline , which did n't mention any tax hikes to discourage smoking , appeared to have been timed so that Republican lawmakers could return to their districts over the July 4th recess and point to the outline as evidence that they are trying to do something to combat teen smoking .",
            "Republican lawmakers face a potential public backlash because Senate Republicans took the lead last week in killing tough anti-smoking legislation managed by Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. That bill would have raised the price of cigarettes by at least $ 1.10 a pack , expanded the federal government 's ability to regulate tobacco advertising and marketing and imposed financial penalties on cigarette makers if they failed to reduce teen smoking .",
            "The House GOP outline was considerably less ambitious .",
            "Under the GOP plan , the director of the White House office of drug policy _ the `` drug czar '' _ would launch an anti-smoking and anti-drug publicity campaign , Pryce said .",
            "`` We want to show kids that smoking is dumb , '' Pryce said .",
            "Rep. John Boehner , R-Ohio , a member of the House leadership and a smoker himself , said the bill would seek to reduce underage smoking , but he added : `` Teen-agers are going to smoke .",
            "It 's one of those rites of passage , if you will . ''",
            "Boehner also said the bill would not settle lawsuits against tobacco companies by state attorneys general or offer the industry any protection from lawsuits .",
            "`` That 's not our business , '' Boehner said in an interview .",
            "`` This is an ongoing effort to go after what the American people want . ''",
            "The plan also would allow states to keep any money they win as a result of lawsuits against the tobacco companies , if their legal fees are `` reasonable '' and `` documented . ''",
            "Those suits typically seek reimbursement for state health-related costs , such as Medicaid payments .",
            "House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt , D-Mo. , denounced the Republican plan as `` an unprincipled attempt to spare tobacco companies from effective regulation . ''",
            "`` Instead of penalizing the tobacco companies for marketing their deadly wares to kids , they want to punish the kids who smoke , '' Gephardt said .",
            "`` This is a classic case of blaming the victim instead of the perpetrator . ''",
            "Gephardt said the Republican plan fails to give full authority to the FDA to regulate cigarettes , fails to propose penalties if tobacco companies do n't curb teen smoking , and fails to restrict the industry from marketing to children .",
            "Long-time tobacco foe Rep. Henry A. Waxman , D-Calif. , called the House Republican plan `` a sham '' designed to provide Republicans with political cover in the November elections .",
            "`` It 's a fraud , '' Waxman said in an interview .",
            "`` But worse , it 's a step backwards . ''",
            "Waxman said the Republican plan only `` pretends '' to give the Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction by allowing it to regulate cigarette manufacturing .",
            "`` This is a payback to the tobacco companies for the $ 12 million that Republicans have received in political contributions since 1995 , '' Waxman said .",
            "But Rep. James V. Hansen , R-Utah , who has sponsored a tough anti-smoking bill along with Waxman and Rep. Marty Meehan , D-Mass. , that would boost the price of a pack of cigarettes by $ 1.50 , was more positive about the Republican leadership 's plan .",
            "`` The leadership proposal is only a very rough skeleton , '' Hansen said .",
            "`` I think we can work this out . ''",
            "McCain said in an interview that the House GOP proposal falls short in several areas .",
            "For example , McCain said revoking driving licenses of teen smokers would do little to stop tobacco use by those too young to drive .",
            "`` What do you do with 15 , 14 , 13 and 12-year-olds ? ''",
            "he said .",
            "McCain also said he is skeptical that any anti-smoking bill would discourage underage smoking unless it hikes tobacco prices .",

            "On Monday , a group of academic researchers , admittedly anti-smoking ones , released a series of six analyses suggesting that the ban has not hurt .",
            "The studies indicated that the anti-smoking law , which took effect on April 10 , 1995 , has had no effect on local sales , job growth or income .",
            "The studies , which were financed by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program , which receives money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , showed that restaurant industry jobs rose 18 percent from 1993 to 1997 , to 19,347 .",
            "During the same period , sales tax receipts rose 2 percent at restaurants in the city but dropped 4 percent in the rest of the state .",
            "The number of restaurants in the city during that period increased 6 percent .",
            "At a news conference , the researchers characterized their work as the first comprehensive look at the city 's ban on smoking in restaurants with 35 or more seats .",
            "They said earlier studies suggesting economic harm were smaller and were financed by the tobacco industry .",
            "`` Local officials can now go about their business of protecting the public from the toxins in second-hand smoke without worrying about this phony issue , '' said Dr. Stanton Glantz , who wrote an editorial accompanying the articles , which are published in the January issue of Public Health Management and Practice .",

            "`` If 75 percent of people do n't smoke and 25 percent do , that means 75 percent are going to eat out more and 25 percent are going to eat out less , '' he said at the news conference .",

            "Scott Wexler , executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association , a trade group , said in an interview that his group sponsored a study in 1996 that showed jobs at city restaurants declining 4 percent .",
            "He said that since his group 's study examined statistics for the months just before and after the law took effect , it could isolate more fairly the `` cataclysmic '' influence of the smoking ban on business .",
            "Wexler said his group 's study showed retail jobs going up 2 percent at the same time that restaurant jobs dropped 4 percent , suggesting that something beyond general economic trends was at work , he said .",
            "Dan Tubridy , who owns Pier 92 , a restaurant in Rockaway Beach , Queens , said in an interview that he lost customers immediately .",
            "`` They said that if they could n't eat at my place they were going to Nassau County , pure and simple , '' he said .",
            "`` And you know what happens ?",
            "They do n't come back . ''",
            "Wexler also pointed out that 8,000 of 15,000 restaurants included in the overall sales tax figures were small enough to allow smoking or were primarily bars , where smoking is also allowed .",
            "The study conducted by Dr. Andrew Hyland , a biostatistician , and two colleagues at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo , acknowledged this limitation .",
            "The restaurant trade group is heavily supported by the Tobacco Institute , which recently admitted funneling $ 443,072 to the group , after earlier claiming a far lower amount .",
            "The money was used to lobby the state Legislature for less stringent laws than the city 's .",
