            "DETROIT ( AP ) -- National labor talks between Detroit 's automakers and the United Auto Workers begin this week in the midst of record-breaking sales that have left General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash .",
            "The triennial negotiations kick off today with ceremonial handshakes over the main bargaining table at Ford headquarters .",
            "Similar ceremonies are set for Tuesday at DaimlerChrysler and Wednesday at GM .",
            "The health of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons learned from last year 's devastating UAW strikes against GM decrease the chance for a walkout after this year 's contracts expire Sept. 14 , some industry analysts say .",
            "`` They 've got tough issues , but nobody wants to put the moneymaking on hold to sort it out , '' said labor professor Harley Shaiken at the University of California-Berkeley .",
            "This year 's talks will cover about 407,000 UAW members at assembly and parts plants nationwide , down 15,000 from 1996 .",
            "More than half work for GM .",
            "Job security , health care costs , overtime demands and the assignment of work to outside suppliers are among the top issues in this year 's talks , as they were during the last round in 1996 .",
            "But since then , the industry has been through a tumultuous series of reorganizations , cost-cutting programs , acquisitions and mergers .",
            "Each of Detroit 's automakers is financially stronger .",
            "`` It 's important to note that for all the changes this is a very healthy industry , one that has enjoyed record profits and sales on a sustained basis , '' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said .",
            "`` It 's a good environment for negotiations . ''",
            "Though times are good , Detroit executives note that they remain under extreme pressure to keep costs down , invest heavily in new models and technology , and simplify the way they build and sell vehicles .",
            "With production capacity worldwide far exceeding demand , automakers can no longer simply pass on higher labor costs to consumers , as they did for decades .",
            "Many of their Asian and European competitors , meanwhile , compete directly on American soil with a growing number of modern , efficient , nonunion plants -- a sore point for Detroit and the UAW .",
            "Against this backdrop , the union is faced with the same problems that have challenged its leaders for the past 20 years : How do they slow the steady decline of high-paying assembly jobs as the industry becomes more efficient and needs fewer workers ?",
            "And as suppliers take on a larger role in the design and assembly of cars and trucks , how can the union expand its influence ?",
            "The UAW only recently has begun to reverse its membership slide , largely by signing up more workers in non-automotive industries .",
            "More than half of its active membership is still employed by the Detroit automakers .",
            "In the last round of auto talks , the union won a conditional guarantee that at least 95 percent of UAW jobs at each plant would be maintained during the life of the contracts .",
            "Much of focus this year will be on GM , which abandoned its combative stance toward the UAW after last year 's strikes cost it about $ 2 billion and some of its U.S. market share .",
            "But GM has managed to continue offending UAW leaders as it seeks ways to cut costs .",
            "Until recently , GM had been publicly promoting ambitious plans to assemble small cars using `` modular '' assembly techniques .",
            "GM says it needs to make the change because its current small cars built in North America do n't make money .",
            "In GM 's modular plants , most of the subassembly work would be done by lower-cost suppliers who would deliver preassembled parts clusters , such as an entire dashboard or interior module , to the assembly plant .",
            "Far fewer UAW workers would be needed .",
            "UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has declared modular assembly a dead issue , but to some extent all three automakers have already adopted or are planning to use more modular techniques .",
            "GM and the union also will have to resolve the future of the 42,640 UAW members at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. , the big parts unit the automaker divested last month .",
            "The union is expecting that those workers will remain under the next GM contract .",
            "The future of parts workers will be an issue at Ford , too , which is preparing plans to spin off its Visteon parts unit .",
            "At Ford and GM , management is likely to seek a lower wage for new hires at the parts concerns so they can more effectively compete against nonunion suppliers .",
            "At DaimlerChrysler , the company that resulted from last year 's acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , the UAW is seeking stronger assurances that the automaker wo n't hinder its attempt to organize the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama and three Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas .",
            "Though DaimlerChrysler 's official position is that it 's neutral in the organizing drives , executives realize it 's a sensitive issue that could cause problems in this year 's talks .",
            "And there is likely to be some concern among UAW negotiators about who 's calling the shots at the Chrysler unit .",
            "`` Daimler is a company used to dealing with a union and negotiation , but it 's not going to be the same as Chrysler , '' said John Revitte , a labor professor at Michigan State University .",
            "`` The fact that it 's now a German company is going to change things . ''",
            "The UAW , meanwhile , has sent signals that it will consider a longer-term contract , most likely a four-year deal .",
            "That would make the next contract expire in 2003 , a year after the union 's leadership is scheduled to change ."

            "DETROIT _ After 13 years without a strike , the Ford Motor Co. is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corp. are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years , union officials and auto executives say .",
            "The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting , three-year national contract for the industry , they said .",
            "The UAW conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996 , and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt GM and the Chrysler Corp. , which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler AG .",
            "Ford wants to sell or spin off its auto parts division and has been reluctant to commit itself recently to building more vehicles and engines at less efficient factories .",
            "Both moves have alarmed local union officials , who have put pressure on the UAW 's national leadership to take a tough stance .",
            "Ford has been negotiating lately to merge the auto parts unit with the Lear Corp. as part of a complicated stock deal .",
            "Those talks are now focused on finding a way to make sure that the transaction is tax free , but no deal is likely until after the expiration on Sept. 14 of the UAW 's contracts with Ford , GM and DaimlerChrysler , people close to the negotiations said .",
            "It now appears possible , although still not certain , that the UAW will negotiate first this year with DaimlerChrysler , leaving for later in the autumn the difficult issues at Ford and the complicated but less contentious issues at GM .",
            "The union has taken a renewed interest in the talks at DaimlerChrysler despite the death earlier this month of Jack Laskowski , the union 's vice president for DaimlerChrysler issues .",

            "Basil Hargrove , the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union , said in an interview that he wanted to hold talks first with Ford this autumn .",
            "This would make it unlikely that the UAW would also negotiate first with Ford .",
            "The American and Canadian unions have a history of not negotiating with the same auto maker at the same time because the American union is so much bigger that the Canadian union might then receive short shrift .",
            "Hargrove said that if the UAW chose Ford , he would most likely choose another auto maker .",
            "But Hargrove works closely with the UAW , and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the UAW will not select Ford , although he added that he did not know what the UAW would do .",
            "The Canadian union also tends to hold short strikes every three years before reaching contracts , often against the first company with which negotiations are held .",
            "That is mainly because Canadian labor laws effectively prevent local units of unions from staging walkouts in the middle of a contract .",
            "But the result may be to ruin Ford 's remarkable string of strike-free years .",
            "Sean McAlinden , the manager of automotive economic studies at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the auto makers and the UAW , said that the Canadian laws made it likely that Hargrove would call a strike at Ford .",

            "The UAW 's contracts do allow such strikes for health and safety reasons .",
            "UAW local units in Flint , Mich. , cited such reasons a year ago in a strike against GM that crippled the company 's North American operations for nearly two months and measurably slowed the American economy during the second and third quarters .",

            "In a speech kicking off the union 's triennial bargaining convention , Yokich said job security would again be the UAW 's priority when it begins contract talks in June with GM , Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG .",

            "`` They claim they lose $ 1,000 on every small car they build themselves .",
            "It 's funny , their competitors -- Ford and Chrysler -- never lose anything on their small cars .",

            "Yokich chastised GM for failing to consult with the UAW before it decided to spin off its big parts unit .",
            "GM had an initial public offering of nearly 18 percent of Delphi Automotive Systems stock earlier this year and plans to spin off the rest of the company to GM shareholders by year 's end .",
            "The move has scared Delphi workers and retirees , said Yokich , who implied that the spinoff was being conducted with little , if any , consultation with UAW leaders .",

            "The automakers -- General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , and DaimlerChrysler AG -- were rewarded , too , apparently winning won the freedom they sought to reduce costs , including shedding workers .",
            "And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry .",
            "`` The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners , '' said John Revitte , a professor at Michigan State University 's School of Labor and Industrial Relations .",
            "As for the automakers , `` I doubt they would have signed it if they thought it was too much , '' Revitte said .",
            "`` They probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker view , and they would n't have any trouble from Wall Street because the economy is doing so well . ''",
            "The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract with 3 percent raises each year , a signing bonus of $ 1,350 and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments .",

            "Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement reached Saturday .",

            "The figure for GM is not available .",
            "The contracts with DaimlerChrysler , GM and GM 's former parts unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling off or closing factories or parts of their businesses .",
            "All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the automakers , which totaled about $ 22 billion in 1998 .",
            "Analyst Scott Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. in New York said the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 percent a year , thanks to the increased wages and health benefits .",
            "But automakers might win that increase back and even save some costs by cutting jobs through retirement .",
            "The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies .",
            "With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive , automakers rely on retirement to shed workers .",
            "The average UAW autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of experience ; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be eligible for retirement in five years .",
            "The contracts sweeten retirement packages , and allow companies to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many replacements must be hired to offset retirements .",
            "When retirements are relatively insignificant , the carmakers would only have to replace one out of every three retirees .",
            "Under the new contract terms , a factory could lose 24 percent of its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would have to replace every additional retiree .",
            "And automakers have been loath to add new workers , preferring instead to fill their needs with overtime .",
            "Last year , GM added 500 hourly workers to its total of about 143,000 , but the average GM worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week .",
            "`` The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side , but it 's highly workable and compatible with improved productivity , '' Merlis said .",

            "Visteon 's current workers would remain Ford employees , while future hires would be covered by a Visteon contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW .",
            "UAW officials had opposed a spin-off or sale of Visteon , fearing it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay .",
            "`` The fact remains there will likely be a spin-off , and this could be achieved without a long strike , and that the Ford-UAW relationship , which has been amicable and enviable , can be sustained , '' Merlis said .",

            "The plants would use far less labor than current assembly plants as outside suppliers , many of them with nonunion workers , would do much work previously done by GM employees .",
            "Smith said the new plants would be modeled mainly on GM 's efficient new operations in Brazil , and to a lesser extent on other GM factories overseas .",
            "Those factories rely on outside suppliers to produce large chunks of vehicles , like fully assembled dashboards , instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together on the assembly line .",
            "That is in keeping with GM 's move this week to become a company that designs , assembles and markets cars and trucks but makes few of the parts .",
            "GM 's new strategy , and particularly Wednesday 's plan for new assembly plants , represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union , which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint , Mich. Four out of every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are not unionized , so shifting work to them weakens the UAW 's grip on the industry and erodes its membership .",
            "UAW officials were studying Wednesday 's announcement and had no immediate reaction .",
            "But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these meetings has been mixed , UAW officials said in recent interviews .",
            "The union leaders are pleased that GM is interested in investing at all in the United States instead of overseas , but deeply troubled by the kinds of factories that GM plans to build .",
            "The new factories could use half as many workers as the current factories .",
            "In a rare speech and news conference in Traverse City , the usually reclusive Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants for the first time , part of a broad vision to change GM , the world 's largest company in terms of sales and share of global economic output .",
            "GM announced Monday that it would turn its vast auto parts subsidiary into an independent company , with stock in the subsidiary , Delphi Automotive Systems , to be distributed next year to GM investors .",
            "GM announced Tuesday that it would combine the corporate staffs of Buick , Cadillac , Chevrolet , GMC , Oldsmobile and Pontiac into a single marketing organization that might be able to sell cars more effectively , although the names on dealerships and car models would not change .",
            "Smith said this week 's moves had long been planned and that the strike had only delayed them a little .",
            "But Smith has also been under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to make GM more competitive .",
            "( STORY CAN END HERE .",
            "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) Some Wall Street analysts even asked publicly during the strike whether Smith was the right person to lead GM , suggesting that while he had led the company back from the brink of bankruptcy after taking over in 1992 , he had taken few bold moves since then and had not laid out a vision for the company 's direction .",
            "Many institutional investors had expected GM to inflict a crushing blow to the UAW at the end of a strike that cost the company $ 3 billion in after-tax earnings , and have pushed down the company 's stock in response to the very limited settlement that actually resulted .",
            "Smith discussed his plans for the company in Traverse City at midday and GM stock closed at $ 68.375 , down $ 1.125 .",

            "`` We are planning on building some new assembly plants to replace and consolidate older plants , '' Smith said .",
            "`` The new plants will be lean and agile in every respect , operating 24 hours a day . ''",

            "Next to each new assembly plant , GM plans to put a factory that could stamp hoods and other automotive body parts from sheets of steel , Smith said .",
            "That plan sheds new light on GM 's strong stand against the UAW during the recent strike in Flint , Mich. GM tried unsuccessfully to stop investing in a low-productivity stamping factory in Flint that would be a logical candidate for closure if GM builds new stamping factories .",
            "In an olive branch to the powerful UAW , Smith said Wednesday that he wanted to develop a closer relationship with union leaders and planned to discuss how the new factories would work .",
            "Speaking at the University of Michigan 's annual auto industry conference here in this Lake Michigan resort , 200 miles northwest of Detroit , Smith also promised repeatedly that GM would not lay off anyone in the coming years , but would rely instead on allowing workers to retire without replacing them .",
            "GM has already eliminated 125,000 hourly jobs in the United States since 1990 by not replacing people who retire or leave for other reasons , and thinks that it can continue reducing its work force this way , he said , adding , `` We 're not talking about layoffs or anything like that , we 're talking about working within the window of our attrition rates . ''",
            "With a steadily shrinking market share , GM has hired few employees since the late 1970 's and has 220,000 hourly workers left in the United States , mostly represented by the UAW The automaker has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival automakers in terms of the number of autos that each worker produces annually .",
            "`` How do we close the productivity gap without costly work stoppages is the clear focus in my head , '' Smith said .",
            "The strikes in Flint severely hurt GM 's sales in July .",
            "The company said Wednesday that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped 37.7 percent , as car sales plunged 45.0 percent while sales of sport utility vehicles , pickups and vans fell 28.1 percent .",
            "GM 's overall share of the light-vehicle market decreased to 21 percent , trailing Ford Motor Co. , at 27.5 percent , for the first time since a two-month strike in 1970 also crippled GM 's production .",
