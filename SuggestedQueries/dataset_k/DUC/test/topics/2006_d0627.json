            "In a report submitted to the 4th meeting of the 9th NPC Standing Committee last Monday , Doje Cering , minister of civil affairs , said that the draft has stricter requirements on adoption of Chinese children by foreigners , but Wan pointed out today that `` requirements '' means adoption procedures .",
            "She said that new procedures could help protect the safety and interests of children who are up for adoption and prevent international crimes .",
            "One of the members , Chen Junliang , said that adoption procedures should be simplified with fewer restrictions for foreigners .",

            "The most sought-after children for adoption are , as they have been for generations , domestic white infants _ known among parents and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI 's _ but those babies are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control , the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single mothers raising children alone .",

            "So while the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been subtle , the increase in visibility has been dramatic , enhanced by those children adopted from other countries whose physical differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact .",

            "The statutes appear designed , in part , to show the incoming leader 's nationalistic stripes , but they are principally intended to halt bribery , child-selling , and other illegal activities allegedly occurring during the course of placing Russian orphans in US adoptive homes .",
            "In particular , bribes of thousands of dollars are regularly doled out to judges , orphanage officials and , most frequently and generously , to bilingual intermediaries who guide would-be parents through often-confusing bureaucratic and judicial systems .",

            "However much good the changes might eventually do , many of those facilities are badly run , lack funds , and are staffed by personnel who mistreat the boys and girls living within them ; experts agree that the longer children remain in such institutions , the greater the emotional and developmental damage they incur .",
            "Those interviewed , however , pointed out that every nation that allows its children to be adopted abroad has periodically revised its rules , especially during changes in government .",

            "The treaty , called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions , is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption , streamline the process , and weed out corruption worldwide .",

            "Constantine , as Michael was named in his native country , spent his first 15 years at the Siret Neuropsychiatric Institution in the northeast corner of Romania .",
            "The facility is widely known as one of the worst legacies of Nicholae Ceausescu , the longtime dictator who was deposed in late 1989 .",
            "As many as 200,000 boys and girls were institutionalized during Ceausescu 's regime , the majority because their parents were too poor to care for them .",
            "Most were abused and deprived of the affection or personal contact necessary to develop normally .",
            "While the current Romanian government has markedly improved conditions , and has begun deinstitutionalization programs , its orphanages generally remain damaging places for children to grow up .",
            "The one in Siret , where about 500 children now live , by all accounts is among the most horrific .",
            "Before children from Siret are deemed ready for adoption by Americans , they undergo years of therapy and behavioral training by a team of US physicians and mental-health professionals who travel to Romania .",
            "The team is led by Ron Federici , a Virginia psychiatrist who is an authority on institutionalization and has adopted four children from Siret himself .",
            "In the case of Constantine and two Romania girls adopted with him , Federici also intensively screened the parental applicants to assess whether they could cope with the difficulties inherent in raising such challenging children .",
            "He approved Lisa and Tim Stamatis of Burlington , who had received high marks for their rearing of five special-needs children they had already adopted .",
            "For the first year , by all accounts , the three Romanian children made substantial progress and everyone seemed happy with the new family arrangement .",
            "But then , for reasons that have n't been explained publicly , something changed dramatically .",
            "Michael , the name the Stamatises gave their son , began to slip .",
            "The boy had a less-than-normal intelligence level and spoke no English , so he 'd always had a hard time communicating .",
            "Now he was growing unresponsive to educational efforts and the sexual acting out that he had done initially _ a frequent behavior for sexually abused children who have n't learned other ways of making physical connections _ began to recur , according to a detective 's report filed in the case .",
            "At the same time , the Stamatises ' willingness or ability to deal with their children 's problems changed , too .",
            "In the last several months , they have moved to legally dissolve their adoptions of Michael , one of his Romanian sisters , and a severely disabled child they had adopted years earlier .",
            "The couple , whose lawyer did not respond to requests for interviews , also filed a complaint alleging Michael had inappropriately fondled the genitalia of both Romanian girls adopted with him .",
            "Federici and others familiar with the case described the parents ' decision to initiate criminal proceedings , rather than to seek treatment , as unusual .",
            "They claim it might have been at least partly a financial move by the Stamatises , who would have been responsible for some child-support payments since they voluntarily relinquished their son into state custody .",
            "When the minor involved is the object of criminal charges , such costs are absorbed by the state .",
            "Michael is currently being treated at a facility in southern Vermont , and no court dates have been set for him .",
            "Vermont officials declined to discuss why they decided to prosecute him as an adult as well as a juvenile .",
            "Federici , Hogan , and the Romanian government insist the boy 's language , cultural , and institutional problems are not being taken sufficiently into account .",
            "`` Imagine how lonely he feels , whatever they are trying to do for him ; he does n't speak the language and he knows nobody around him , '' said Federici , who is fluent in Romanian and has tried to become a party to the court cases involving Michael .",
            "He has been rebuffed both by the judge and other state officials .",
            "They have not said why they have excluded the psychiatrist 's participation as an expert witness or as a therapist , though he has volunteered to play either role at his own expense .",
            "Federici said he is so concerned about Michael 's welfare he has offered take the boy and his adoptive sisters off of Vermont 's hands altogether , again at his own expense .",
            "He wants to find other homes for the girls and to place Michael in a specialized treatment facility in Baltimore , where there are other onetime Romanian orphans with whom Michael is friends and with whom he has seen during reunions arranged by Federici .",
            "The press and science attache at the Romanian Embassy , Stefan Maier , has drafted a letter , which the ambassador is now reviewing , praising Federici 's efforts and asking Vermont officials to reconsider the psychiatrist 's participation .",
            "This episode , writes Maier , could `` trigger a mechanism with the potential of bringing damage to international adoption by US citizens from Romania . ''",
