            "WASHINGTON _ The nation 's overall crime rate in 1997 fell for the sixth consecutive year , with the rate of violent crimes such as murders and robberies showing the sharpest drop , the FBI reported Sunday .",
            "The nation 's big cities experienced the steepest decline in their crime rate , with a 5 percent drop , while suburban counties saw a decrease of 4 percent , and rural areas were down 1 percent .",
            "Criminal experts and law enforcement officials attributed the drop to several factors , including the aging of baby boomers , increased incarceration of criminals , declining use of crack , additional police officers and better policing methods .",
            "Overall , the rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent from 1996 , helping to push down the overall U.S. crime rate by 3 percent , its lowest level in over a decade , the FBI reported .",
            "Murders fell by more than 7 percent to 18,209 .",
            "In the past four years , the murder rate has plummeted by more than 25 percent .",
            "Robberies fell 8 percent , while aggravated assaults and forcible rapes decreased 2 percent and 1 percent , respectively .",
            "`` It 's definitely continues the trend of good news about crime , '' said James Alan Fox , dean of Northeastern University 's College of Criminal Justice .",
            "But Fox cautioned : `` People should remember that these numbers are n't the full story .",
            "In the coming years , these declines could turn quickly . ''",
            "Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are influencing the nation 's crime rate .",
            "First , the aging of the baby boom generation , which makes up 25 percent of the population , has pushed down the number of crimes because adults tend to be less violent than juveniles .",
            "At the same time , the number of crimes committed by teen-agers has risen sharply since the mid-1980s .",
            "The number of murders committed by teen-agers increased 145 percent between 1985 and 1995 .",
            "And although the number of violent crimes committed by juveniles has fallen slightly in the past two years , the number of teen-agers will grow quickly over the next decade .",
            "Currently , there are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide .",
            "Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society deals with the rising tide of teen-agers over the next decade .",
            "`` Right now , crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the end of school and when most parents get home for dinner , '' he said .",
            "`` That tells you that our children are not getting enough supervision from their parents . ''",
            "At a press conference Thursday , Attorney General Janet Reno warned Americans not to `` relax their vigilance about crime , about enforcement , about prevention . ''",
            "She said the large number of people growing through their teens and early 20s over the next decade presents law enforcement officials with a challenge , but that these kids do not have to become criminals .",
            "`` We 've got to make sure , as we have more young people , that we have more programs for them , more opportunities to give them a strong and positive future , '' Reno said .",
            "All regions of the country saw crime rates fall in 1997 , with the Northeast experiencing the largest drop , 5 percent , the FBI report said .",
            "The crime rate in the West and South declined nearly 3 percent , while the Midwest saw a drop of 2 percent .",
            "The FBI report also said the rate of property crimes , burglaries and larceny fell 3 percent , while the rate of motor vehicle thefts dropped 4 percent .",

            "The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders , rapes , robberies and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level since 1985 , according to the report .",
            "The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998 , down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989 , the FBI said .",
            "A total of 16,914 murders were reported last year -- one murder every 31 minutes , but it still was the lowest murder rate -- six slayings for every 100,000 people -- since 1967 .",
            "Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime rate to `` more police officers on the street , greater partnerships between law enforcement agencies , continued efforts to keep guns away from criminals , and a balanced approach that includes prevention , intervention , punishment and supervision . ''",
            "`` This is good news for America 's families , and it shows we can indeed turn the tide on crime , '' President Bill Clinton said in a statement .",

            "WASHINGTON _ The rate of violent crime in the United States continued a downward trend in 1999 , with the 10 percent drop last year representing one of the largest decreases in decades , the Justice Department said Sunday .",
            "The latest figures , released by the department 's Bureau of Justice Statistics , show a continuation of declines in every major type of personal and property crime between 1993 and 1999 .",
            "During this period , the rate of violent crimes in general declined 32.7 percent , while robbery with injury dropped 38.5 percent , aggravated assault decreased 41.2 percent and rape fell 40 percent .",
            "Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey , begun in 1972 , show that property crime rates continue a 25-year downward trend .",
            "Crime rates involving property , including burglary and motor vehicle theft , dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999 , decreasing from 217 per 1,000 U.S. households to 198 per 1,000 households .",

            "`` After a period of slow decline that was interrupted by an increase from 1980 to 1981 , the burglary rate fell each year through the rest of the period , '' the Justice Department report said .",
            "`` The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of the adjusted rate of 1973 . ''",
            "Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy , crime prevention programs , tougher sentences and more police officers on the street .",
            "As with earlier reports of similar declines , President Clinton called the figures `` further proof that the Clinton-Gore administration 's anticrime strategy of more police on our streets and fewer guns in the wrong hands has helped to create the safest America in a generation . ''",
            "Ray Sullivan , a spokesman for the Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush 's headquarters , told The Associated Press : `` It 's typical for the Clinton-Gore administration to take credit for good things in America .",

            "The crime rate report is based upon information on nonlethal violent and property crimes gathered during the annual National Crime Victimization Survey .",
            "In 1999 , 42,895 households and 77,750 people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey .",

            "The combination of guns and drugs was his undoing : Under a new program aimed at gun offenders called Project Exile , prosecutors were able to charge Smith in the tougher federal system .",
            "He is now serving 16 and a half years in a federal prison .",
            "As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets , Project Exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in Richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system , where bond is less available , sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms .",
            "Project Exile has not only helped to reduce crime in Richmond , but it has also brought together officials from other cities and the National Rifle Association in an expanding experiment to see whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing laws already on the books , rather than fighting over new laws .",
            "While the Justice Department , long an adversary of the rifle association over gun control , has held back from recommending Project Exile as a cure-all , and a panel of federal judges in Richmond has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state matters , Philadelphia and Rochester , N.Y. , have adopted versions of the program , and more than a dozen other cities are considering it .",
            "While homicide rates have dropped across the country for a variety of reasons , the authorities in Richmond contend that Project Exile helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by 36 percent last year , to 78 homicides from 122 in 1997 , one of the steepest declines in any city .",
            "The program has also helped the authorities solve older cases .",

            "Soon , the total number of people locked up in federal and state prisons and local jails will likely reach the 2 million mark , almost double the number a decade ago , as the ranks of prisoners grow enough each year _ to fill Yankee Stadium and then some .",
            "For an American born this year , the chance of living some part of life in a correction facility is 1 in 20 ; for black Americans , it is 1 in 4 .",
            "Most experts failed to predict that the inmate population would triple from 1980 , and now nobody seems to know how to stop the buildup .",
            "By all logic , prisons should be experiencing a few vacancies , and the cost of arresting , prosecuting and putting away an army of criminals should be at ebb .",

            "For virtually all other crimes , of course , the figures are stunning _ with huge drops in murder , robbery and assault .",
            "Whether this is because the United States will soon have 2 million people locked up is subject to much debate .",
            "But many of the authorities who argue that the prison boom has taken the worst criminals out of circulation _ and has thus been the biggest factor in reducing crime _ are at a loss to explain the drug-use figures .",

            "The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New York 's television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the city 's crime rate has dropped for the last half-dozen years .",
            "The crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days are noticeably different , having a greater emphasis on sexual attacks and child abuse .",
            "There are more reports on crimes in the suburbs and the outer reaches of the region , as well as stepped-up coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself , including police misconduct .",
            "But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime _ particularly in New York City 's three major daily newspapers _ where change is most pronounced .",
            "In the first two weeks of May 1994 , for example , there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in The New York Daily News , The New York Post and The New York Times .",
            "In the first two weeks of May this year , there were only a third as many articles about crime in the three newspapers : 44 altogether , including several on crimes in the suburbs .",
            "On many days in May , there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post , where once it was a staple .",
            "On local television news , which has been criticized for years for its daily diet of murder and mayhem , there appears to be a reduction as well , though much more modest .",
            "It is impossible to quantify , because news directors at New York 's major network-owned stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of old broadcasts .",
            "There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the contents of local news four or more years ago .",
            "But many current and former television news executives say that for many years at least 30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were about crime .",
            "The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the three network-owned stations with the largest audiences _WCBS-TV , WNBC-TV and WABC-TV _ over four weeks this summer , and crime was the subject of 27 percent of the reports .",
            "On some evenings , reports about crime represented a majority of the reports on local news shows , and many minutes of air time at the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them .",
            "But on other nights , crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows .",
            "These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent crime in New York , where the number of killings has diminished from 2,245 in 1990 to 767 last year .",
            "At the current rate , there would be fewer than 600 this year , the lowest total in three decades .",
            "Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions , especially by people who manage local television news operations , to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports .",
            "`` There is a positive feeling overall , and I think reporters and editors come into the workplace feeling that , because we all live in the same community , '' said WCBS-TV news director Bill Carey .",
            "`` We look for stories that are relevant to the life that we live . ''",
            "Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result of police department policies that make it more difficult to get information on crime and access to police officials .",
            "Six or seven years ago , when there were nearly six killings a day in New York City , on average , the basic question for crime reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover .",
            "There was seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police Department as an institution .",
            "Crime news often crowded out other subjects on television .",
            "`` Today , there is less and less crime that is worthy of any coverage , '' said Bart Feder , news director at Channel 7 , WABC-TV .",
            "`` This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting and diverse way .",
            "I think there is more commitment at all the stations to enterprise reporting , to investigative reporting , to honest-to-goodness journalism . ''",
            "Feder 's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the same assessment , and on some nights there is evidence to buttress their view .",
            "But careful viewing of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary .",
            "Some nights , local stations compensate for the murder gap by covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local crimes that , not long ago , would have passed unnoticed .",
            "A few weeks ago , for example , Channel 7 sent a reporter to Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police cars on highways to counter road rage .",
            "Local stations also reported in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold , N.J. , accused of stabbing his wife , a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx motel and a double homicide in Bayonne , N.J .",
            "But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism on local stations , reports on serious subjects that might have had difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed by body bags .",
            "On Aug. 28 , Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock market 's slide might affect New York City 's budget .",
            "The previous week , a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate .",
            "nn Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still too much crime on local television .",
            "`` There 's no question that it is still the predominant item , '' said David Klatell , head of the broadcast program at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Journalism .",
            "`` Television news has always been a much more emotive and emotional medium than a logical one , and so the fear of crime persists even if the reality does n't .",
            "It 's much easier to cover crime than to cover the school system or race relations . ''",
            "Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to study the content of local television news two years ago .",
            "They analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the 1996-1997 television season .",
            "The survey showed that 27.2 percent of the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime , well above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent .",
            "A similar analysis of the television season that ended last spring is not finished .",
            "Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News , the all-news cable station , with influencing coverage on the larger network-owned stations .",
            "Since it started in 1992 , NY1 has tried to balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods .",
            "Steve Paulus , the senior vice president for news at NY1 , said that his station was devoting less time to crime these days .",
            "`` Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the day , '' he said , `` the police reporter is now more likely to be covering police department issues . ''",
            "Paradoxically , the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause journalists to react more strongly to major crimes .",

            "`` There is an added shock value now when they happen . ''",
            "Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share information less readily and are generally less cooperative .",
