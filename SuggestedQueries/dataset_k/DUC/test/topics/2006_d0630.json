            "LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Unhappy with an author they once honored , independent booksellers overwhelmingly approved a resolution criticizing Frank McCourt for appearing in a television ad for the on-line superstore barnesandnoble.com .",
            "The American Booksellers Association , with a core membership of some 3,300 independent stores , voted Saturday at BookExpo America to draft a letter to McCourt expressing disappointment .",
            "He is the author of the hugely popular `` Angela 's Ashes '' and the upcoming sequel `` Tis . ''",
            "`` I 've never asked for an apology in my life and I 've never given one .",
            "What I do I do .",
            "...",
            "If I get a letter from them it 'll go back unopened , '' said McCourt , a featured speaker at BEA .",
            "The expo , a three-day exhibition and trade show that ended Sunday , is the publishing industry 's annual national convention .",
            "It was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center .",
            "The ABA 's letter will be sent to a beloved writer , and not just with readers .",
            "Two years ago , the association presented McCourt its annual ABBY award , given to the author whose book they most enjoyed selling .",
            "His memoir was a surprise success and he has given a lot of the credit to independents .",
            "`` If they ( independent stores ) had wanted me to do a commercial I would have done one for them , too .",
            "I 'm not a politician .",
            "I just did what my publisher requested , '' McCourt said Sunday .",
            "The resolution is actually far lighter than the original proposed by independent seller Andy Ross , owner of Cody 's Books Inc. in Berkeley .",
            "Ross , condemning the `` hypocrisy of writers and intellectuals , '' had wanted the ABA to call for McCourt to give back his ABBY award .",
            "The booksellers overwhelmingly rejected that idea as too harsh .",
            "`` I really offered this resolution in a spirit to generate discussion , '' Ross said .",
            "`` They ( writers ) talk about independent booksellers at cocktail parties , but they 're afraid to speak up .",
            "The chains have become so powerful . ''",
            "Other writers appearing in ads for barnesandnoble.com include Tom Clancy and Stephen King , another vocal supporter of independents .",
            "`` In retrospect , I understand how they feel , but I never really anticipated it , '' said Susan Moldow , vice president and publisher of Scribner , an imprint of Simon & AMP ; Schuster that publishes both McCourt and King .",
            "Asked if he 'd do another superstore ad , McCourt said `` I 'd be very careful the next time .",
            "From now on , I probably wo n't do anything . ''",
            "The ABA action highlighted a weekend of tough talk .",
            "The association aggressively promoted its answer to Amazon.com and other on-line sellers , BookSense.com , to be open for business late summer .",
            "And individual members accused Barnes & AMP ; Noble , Amazon.com and other `` bad corporate citizens '' of everything from false advertising to stealing customers .",
            "`` We are fighting for our lives , '' said ABA president Richard Howorth .",
            "Booksellers received both bad news and good news at BEA .",
            "A new consumer survey said that adults in the U.S. bought 30 million fewer books in 1998 than the year before .",
            "The apparent culprit was an odd one : A good economy .",
            "`` In good times , consumers seem to spend their money on other kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods .",
            "In tighter economic times , consumers once again think about books , '' said Sandra Paul , managing agent of the Book Industry Study Group , which conducted the survey .",
            "But the ABA , which has lost nearly 2,000 stores over the past decade , also reported a long-hoped for statistic .",
            "In March of this year , the number of stores increased slightly , the first monthly improvement in recent memory .",
            "`` It 's been going against us for a long time , but it 's going to go the other way , '' said Avin Mark Domnitz , the ABA 's chief executive officer .",
            "Meanwhile , there was still plenty of time to talk about books .",
            "Major upcoming releases include McCourt 's new book ; `` Dutch , '' Edmund Morris ' long-awaited memoir about former President Ronald Reagan ; Sue Grafton 's latest lettered mystery , `` O is For Outlaw , '' and `` Hannibal , '' Thomas Harris ' sequel to `` The Silence of the Lambs .

            "In the past 12 months , the German conglomerate Bertelsmann AG completed its purchase of Random House , Barnes & AMP ; Noble Inc. announced it would buy the world 's largest wholesaler , the Ingram Book Group , and Bertelsmann and Barnes & AMP ; Noble announced a joint investment in the on-line seller barnesandnoble.com .",
            "Meanwhile , as big business gets bigger , smaller business simply disappears .",
            "Since the early 1990s , bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500 , much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion .",

            "`` While it 's still a wonderful occupation , it 's awfully scary . ''",
            "In 1997 , about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & AMP ; Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores .",
            "In 1991 , independents received 32.5 percent of sales and chains 22 percent .",
            "Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002 .",
            "BEA wo n't turn that around , but for a few days it gives independent sellers a chance to meet , commiserate and plan .",
            "One proposed change is to reduce the ABA 's board of directors , from 20 to nine .",
            "`` We 're trying to make the board more responsive , more nimble and able to react quickly , '' said Howorth , `` because everything is changing so fast . ''",
            "Losing customers both in cyberspace and in their neighborhoods , independents are fighting back any way they can .",

            "You ca n't just sit around and be a guy in the shop and think life is going to go on the way it 's been , '' Howorth said .",
            "Publishers face a problem directly related to the convention : introducing their fall books , their main reason for coming to BookExpo .",

            "`` We 're cataloguing books we 're not even sure are going to be ready on schedule . ''",
            "But once in Los Angeles , there will be plenty of time for promotions , parties and seminars .",
            "And , at least around meal times , the industry will pause and let the writers talk .",
            "Featured speakers include Nobelist Elie Wiesel , Pulitzer Prize winners Frank McCourt and Jorie Graham , as well as Robert Stone , Ward Just , David Guterson and Nikki Giovanni .",

            "For readers living far from a bookstore , the system offered a convenient alternative .",
            "But with the rise of online bookselling and instant purchases at the click of a computer mouse , book clubs in the late 1990s were forced to offer something more than discounts .",

            "`` If these two clubs could cut down on their promotion and mailing costs they could save a lot of money . ''",
            "During the 1990s consolidation narrowed the chief players in the book club business to three companies , Bertelsmann 's Doubleday Direct , Time Inc. 's Book-of-the-Month Club and Rodale Press ' & UR ; & LR ; six holdings , including the health-oriented Prevention Book Club .",
            "To counter online competition , the book clubs refined their marketing techniques and promoted their ability to filter choice books on specialty topics for harried readers who did not have the time to do it themselves .",
            "The Book-of-the-Month Club sells general hardcover titles , but it also includes eight other clubs that offer books in niche markets like the One Spirit Christian Book Club or the History Book Club .",
            "Together all of the clubs have a combined membership of 4.5 million members , according to the company .",
            "Last year the Book-of-the-Month Club 's revenues were estimated at about $ 280 million , roughly comparable to the revenues of Doubleday Direct .",
            "Doubleday says it has a membership list of 4.8 million with book clubs that include the Literary Guild , as well as a collection of other smaller clubs like the fast-growing Christian club , Crossings , and a children 's book club .",
            "The most recent statistics from the Association of American Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their own , but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as online booksellers .",
            "Mail order companies like Readers Digest that have suffered from a free fall in sales , which have plunged as much as 20 percent from a year earlier .",
            "For the year through October , net sales for book clubs had reached $ 950 million , an increase of 4.5 percent over the comparable period a year earlier .",
            "Last year , with $ 1.2 billion in book club sales , that category accounted for 5.4 percent of the total $ 22 billion book market that includes consumer books , textbooks , and professional titles .",
            "Bertelsmann also has a substantial stake in the online business , with a 40 percent interest in Barnesandnoble.com .",
            "Under the tentative plans , Bertelsmann and Time Inc. will allow the two literary clubs to remain in their present locations with separate identities _ the Book-of-the-Month Club in Manhattan and the Literary Guild in Garden City , N.Y. & QL ;"
