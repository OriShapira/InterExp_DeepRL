            "On Monday , Richard Smith , president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in Cambridge , Mass. , made a phone call to the FBI .",
            "Smith thought he 'd figured out the identity of an electronic criminal _ the malevolent hacker who 'd created the notorious Melissa computer virus .",
            "Smith was n't absolutely certain of the virus writer 's identity , but after long hours of investigation he 'd come up with two names .",
            "One of them was that of a man he 'd never met and certainly was n't related to _ David L. Smith .",
            "Late Thursday night , the FBI reached the same conclusion , arresting 30-year-old computer programmer David L. Smith of Aberdeen , N.J. , and alleging that he distributed the Melissa virus .",
            "Federal agents and New Jersey State Police tracked David Smith to his brother 's house in Eatontown , New Jersey , and charged him Friday with interruption of public communications , conspiracy , and third-degree theft of computer service .",
            "After his arrest , David Smith was released on $ 100,000 bond .",
            "He is scheduled for arraignment on Monday .",
            "If convicted , Smith could receive up to 40 years in prison .",

            "That should sit well with computer network administrators across the country who 've spend the past week scrambling to stave off the effects of Melissa .",
            "Disguised as a list of pornographic Internet sites and allegedly named after a stripper David Smith once knew , Melissa is a `` macro virus , '' a document with a malignant computer program built in .",
            "People who read the document using Microsoft Word , the popular word-processing program made by Microsoft Corp. , could infect their computers .",
            "If the infected machine had a copy of Microsoft 's Outlook e-mail program , Melissa would send a copy of itself to the first 50 people in the Outlook address book .",
            "Since both Word and Outlook are so widely used , the Melissa virus spread with shocking speed .",
            "It first appeared on a sex-related Internet bulletin board last Friday .",
            "By Saturday , major corporations such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. were shutting down their Internet access to cope with torrents of unwanted mail , or simply to ensure their machines did n't get infected .",
            "Driven by sheer curiosity , Richard Smith has spent the last week in the hunt for Melissa 's author .",
            "But the FBI apparently did n't need his help .",

            "Richard Smith had hoped to use a more radical approach .",
            "Last month , Smith shocked privacy advocates by finding a secret serial number , called a GUID , embedded in documents created by Microsoft Word .",
            "Since the Melissa virus lurks inside a Microsoft Word document , Smith hoped he could identify its author by reading Melissa 's serial number .",
            "A tip from a Swedish computer expert sent Richard Smith to a Web site run by a virus writer who identified himself with the screen name of VicodenES .",
            "Smith downloaded copies of the viruses posted on the site .",
            "Then he used a `` hex editor , '' a piece of software that lets programmers read the raw data hidden inside a computer file .",
            "Smith planned to use the `` hex dumps '' of the VicodenES files to check for the file 's GUID .",
            "Sure enough , he found that some of these files had the same serial number as Melissa .",
            "But along the way , he also checked a feature of Microsoft Word that stores the names of people who create or modify files .",
            "A number of names appeared again and again .",
            "Some were plainly phony ones , like Ben Dover .",
            "But others seemed more believable .",
            "And in three separate files , he found the name David Smith , or the initials DLS .",
            "A spokeswoman for the New Jersey attorney general 's office said Friday that David Smith was `` definitely not '' VicodenES .",
            "Investigators believe he took one virus from VicodinES and combined it with another virus to create Melissa .",
            "Richard Smith 's examination of the Microsoft GUID serial number led him to the same conclusion .",
            "Richard Smith got an e-mail Wednesday from Rishi Khan , a 19-year-old senior in computer engineering at the University of Delaware .",
            "Khan told him that the contents of the Melissa file were nearly identical to a virus called Shiver that was released sometime last year by someone calling himself Alt-F11 .",
            "Smith and Khan found that Shiver and Melissa had the same Microsoft serial number , and even the same list of pornographic Web sites .",
            "The implication was obvious to Smith .",
            "Melissa 's creator started out with Shiver , then modified it _ a common practice among virus writers .",
            "`` He wrote the Melissa virus in a separate file , '' said Richard Smith .",
            "`` When it was all written , he needed some bait to catch people with . ''",
            "Richard Smith believes that the virus writer merely removed the polluted code in Shiver and replaced it with his own .",
            "Richard Smith has no idea whether Alt-F11 and the creator of Melissa worked together , or if they 're only connected by their love of virus-writing .",
            "But he hopes the FBI will try to find out .",
            "`` There 's someone else running around who may be material to this case , '' Smith said .",
            "Smith says he neglected his successful software business and stayed up into the wee hours in an effort to track down the author of Melissa .",
            "The FBI had it somewhat easier _ it had more manpower and the cooperation of America Online .",
            "The Melissa virus had been posted onto the Internet using an AOL account belonging to Scott Steinmetz , a civil engineer in Lynnwood , Wash. Steinmetz proclaimed his innocence and AOL concluded that someone had stolen access to his account .",
            "Together AOL , the FBI , and New Jersey law enforcement officials traced the identity theft back to David Smith .",

            "In a more sophisticated examination , however , it is found that the new offshoot of the virus is much more dangerous as it will attaches itself to every file on the victims ' computer drivers , while the previous bug reportedly written by a Filipino only attacked selected multimedia files .",
            "The destructive move could be accomplished between 20 seconds to one minute , wiping out all files and only leaving a user with a blank hard disc once attempting to reboot .",

            "No computer connected to the Internet should be without one .",
            "An antivirus program is designed to recognize telltale virus signatures and to intercept and destroy the rogue code before it has a chance to infect the computer .",

            "When a new virus like Melissa appears , it could slip past any antivirus program that has not been updated to catch it .",

            "Both are about $ 50 and include a one-year subscription for online updates , and both quickly posted Melissa updates on their sites .",

            "Almost all of the major antivirus programs can easily be updated over the Internet , through a relatively quick download that updates the program 's database of known virus signatures .",
            "In some cases the user does not have to do anything ; the downloads are performed automatically .",
            "Not using this feature in effect defeats the purpose of the software .",
            "The third rule is more Draconian : Never open e-mail attachments or download files unless you are absolutely confident of their contents , even if they are not Word files .",
            "It would be trivial for a malicious programmer to modify Melissa to affect Excel files , for example , and apparently someone has done just that , in a new virus called Papa .",
            "The conventional advice is never to open any attachment sent by a stranger , but with Melissa , and with several other new viruses designed to propagate via e-mail , the files almost always come from acquaintances , even friends .",
            "If you use Word 97 , go to the Word toolbar and click Tools , then Options , then General , then make sure there is a check mark in the box labeled `` Macro virus protection . ''",
