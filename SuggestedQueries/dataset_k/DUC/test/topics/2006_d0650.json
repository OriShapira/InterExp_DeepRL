            "LAGOS , July 1 ( Xinhua ) -- The much-speculated postponement of Nigeria 's governorship election to next year was confirmed during a meeting between Head of State General Sani Abacha and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter on Sunday .",
            "At a news conference in Abuja , the capital , at the end of his two-day visit to Nigeria , Carter said General Abacha confirmed the shift to him , according to local press reports today .",
            "But Carter gave no details of the election originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year according to the military administration 's three-year transition to civil rule program announced in October 1995 .",
            "`` He was pleading with me that although the election of governors for this year will not be held as scheduled in October , the governorship election will be held next year , the same year as election for president , '' Carter added .",
            "He said Abacha reassured him on certain decisions made by the government to have free and democratic elections so that the October 1 , 1998 military disengagement date could be realized .",
            "The former U.S. president said there was no assurance yet on the release of former head of state General Obasanjo and Major-General Yar'Adua imprisoned on alleged involvement of a coup , as well as the detention of Chief M.K.O .",
            "Abiola for alleged treason .",
            "Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled presidential election in 1993 .",
            "Their imprisonment was the cause of the lingering strained relations between Nigeria and America , said Carter , now head of the Carter Center , a foundation committed to the eradication of Guinea-worm and river blindness in Africa .",
            "He said : `` A lot of problems have been brought about by the fact that the rule of law in Nigeria has not been prosecuted properly . ''",
            "However , while kicking against the imposition of further sanctions on Nigeria , Carter said he would see improved diplomatic ties between Abuja and Washington .",
            "Western countries have imposed sanctions on Nigeria since the military administration 's execution of nine minority nationality activists in November 1995 .",
            "The alleged poor human rights record in the country has come under fresh attack from Britain and the U.S. , with the new British Labor government vowing that it would not compromise its tough stand until there is a positive change by the military government .",
            "The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group ( CMAG ) has invited Nigeria 's opposition National Democratic Coalition and several pro-democracy groups to London for discussion on the country 's political situation .",
            "The discussions , expected for July 10 , are to enable CMAG to decide whether the suspension slammed on Nigeria two years ago should be lifted , retained or even changed to expulsion ."

            "It has become something of a cliche to refer to Carter as the greatest ex-president in the nation 's history , a tribute to countless good works he has done since he was defeated for re-election nearly two decades ago .",
            "But Clinton , in his remarks , noted thoughtfully that the `` greatest ex-president '' label does Carter an injustice because everything he has done since leaving the White House is an extension of priorities that characterized his presidency .",
            "Did we say countless good works ?",
            "In his medal citation , Clinton attached some impressive numbers to Carter 's record of service to humanity : The 115 countries Carter has visited either on missions to promote peace and human rights or to combat disease and hunger .",

            "The list goes on and on .",
            "Mrs. Carter , too , has earned the admiration of the nation for carrying through on causes that were dear to her even before her years in the White House and the Georgia Governor 's Mansion , especially her work to improve treatment of mental illnesses and to make child immunizations widely available .",
            "Carter acknowledged Monday that he and Rosalynn left the White House somewhat deflated after his election defeat in 1980 , but they managed to build new lives full of pleasure , adventure and challenge .",
            "That should be an instructive example for a youngish ex-president-to-be who is concerned about his own place in history .",

            "To many minds , Jimmy Carter is the best ex-president in history .",
            "That may underestimate John Quincy Adams , who received his posthumous due in `` Amistad , '' but folks who did n't much like him as president but love him as an ex probably do n't know the half of Carter 's late career .",
            "That gap is admirably filled by Douglas Brinkley , a historian at the Eisenhower Center of the University of New Orleans .",
            "Still , most readers will decide they 'd rather admire Jimmy Carter than be him .",
            "He 's known for work with Habitat for Humanity , which builds housing for low-income families , which goes beyond photo opportunities to honest sweat , as well as for quixotic peacemaking efforts .",
            "But they may not know how much Carter 's moral suasion had to do with Daniel Ortega 's accepting the results of the Nicaraguan election that deposed him .",
            "And they may not know just how many elections he has monitored ( 17 ) or that he 's responsible for distributing medications for preventing river blindness to more than 11 million people as well as nearly eradicating several diseases , and winning freedom for political prisoners , 50,000 of them by rough count .",
            "He 's also written a fat , dry memoir of his presidency and breezy , interesting books on the Middle East , elections , religion and fishing .",
            "Wife Rosalyn has written a book ( on growing old ) with him and others on her own .",
            "There is life after Washington .",
            "In the name of peace , he buddied up to Yasser Arafat ; the late mad dictator of North Korea , Kim Il-sung ; the clueless communist Ortega ; Haitian bully Raoul Cedras ; and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic of the Bosnian Serbs .",
            "Sometimes , he has been effective .",
            "We occupied Haiti without bloodshed when he talked Cedras into going .",
            "A boat ride with Kim Il-sung may have averted the second Korean war .",
            "But none of his solutions have been permanent , and sometimes he just got in the way , as in Bosnia .",
            "In his own book , Richard Holbrooke , who brokered the Dayton peace accord , tells how Karadzic tried to cash in on his relations with Carter .",
            "Holbrooke snapped back that Bill Clinton is president , not Jimmy Carter .",
            "Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic ( no sweet guy himself ) thanked Holbrooke privately .",

            "Clinton 's first secretary , Warren Christopher , cut Carter off completely even though he had been Carter 's personal attorney and Carter lobbied to get him the job .",
            "Their problem was not only that they never knew what Carter was saying to thugs , but that he had a bad habit of announcing deals to the CNN crew Ted Turner sends everywhere with him before telling Washington what was in the deal .",
            "Critics see that as grand-standing .",
            "Carter may see it as ensuring that the deal is known before the boffins at the White House and State Department spin it away .",
            "Brinkley records all of this at a steady pace without bogging down in psychology .",

            "This reader , anyway , felt sympathy for presidents and secretaries of state on the sidelines of some of Carter 's excellent adventures , even when Carter had logic on his side .",
            "Simply , the man is single-minded , impervious to advice and needlessly offensive toward the good guys .",
