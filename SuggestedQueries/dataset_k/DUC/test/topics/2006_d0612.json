            "ATLANTA _ Aside from Hollywood 's sometimes inaccurate portrayal of autism , few people know much about the disorder .",
            "A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society of America , `` 2000 National Conference on Autism : Celebrating Our Future , '' is focusing on treatment options , research and the incidence of autism .",
            "The conference continues through Wednesday .",
            "`` We hope to bring in 1,000 attendees , and , hopefully , people will have a better understanding about autism at the end of the conference , '' said Vernell Henry , director of conferences for the society .",
            "Parents and people whose family members are affected by autism are the target group of the conference , which is organized around five areas : communications ; education ; family and community ; medicine and research ; and options for adulthood and independence .",
            "Autism was previously thought to affect one in 500 people , but the number is actually closer to one in 250 , according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .",
            "Here are some frequently asked questions about the disorder , with answers by the Autism Society of America : Q : What is autism ?",
            "A : Autism is a complex developmental disease that is four times more prevalent in boys than girls .",
            "It affects the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills .",
            "No one knows what the cause of autism is .",
            "It knows no racial , ethnic or social boundaries .",
            "Adults and children living with autism usually have difficulty with verbal and nonverbal communication , and leisure or play activities .",
            "In some cases , aggressive and self-injurious behavior may be present .",
            "They may exhibit repeated body movements , such as hand flapping and rocking , unusual responses to people or attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routine .",
            "Some people with autism may also have other disorders that affect functioning of the brain such as epilepsy , mental retardation and Down syndrome .",
            "They may also have genetic disorders such as Tourette 's syndrome or Williams syndrome .",
            "Q : What causes autism ?",
            "A : Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain , but no specific cause .",
            "Autism is not a mental illness .",
            "It is not caused by bad parenting , and children with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave .",
            "Q : What are some of the treatments ?",
            "A : Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to highly structured , specialized education programs tailored to their needs .",
            "Early intervention leads to better results .",
            "Q : Is there a way to diagnose autism ?",
            "A : There are no medical tests .",
            "Accurate diagnoses should be based on observation of an individual 's communication , behavior and developmental levels .",
            "Signs of autism typically appear during the first three years of life .",
            "Q : Should parents shelter their children once it is determined they have autism ?",
            "A : `` It is very important that children be kept close to other developing children , '' said Gail McGee , director of the autism center at Emory University .",
            "Parents should push for children 's inclusion in normal social activities to induce growth and development in that area , she said .",

            "The rate is several times higher than past estimates , although the true rate of autism is controversial because there has never been a nationwide study .",

            "A poorly understood disorder , autism is thought to occur early in pregnancy .",
            "In moderate to severe cases , autism makes it difficult to communicate or relate to the outside world , and drives some to obsessively repeat certain motions , even hurt themselves or others .",
            "Data from California , South Florida and other areas have shown a sharp increase in recent years in children receiving special educational services for autism , and parents in New York 's Staten Island and other communities have complained of possible autism clusters , though no autism cluster has ever been documented .",
            "In 1997 , a group of worried Brick parents conducted a survey that found a high enough level of autism in this coastal town of 71,000 that state health officials and politicians won federal funding for a comprehensive investigation .",

            "'' I think this ( study ) is going to bring more and more attention to autism and the fact that it 's not a rare disorder , that we need more attention to diagnosis , '' so affected children can get treatment earlier and reach a higher level of function , said Dr. Audrey Mars , an assistant pediatrics professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey who examined many of the children .",

            "Some genes suppress cellular activity while others ramp it up , setting the correct balance of chemicals involved in transmitting brain signals .",
            "After birth , different genes begin to nurse connections while others cause cells to die off in a dynamic dance of growth and pruning .",
            "But the growth and elaboration of the nervous system is a continuous process and if something goes seriously wrong early on , all subsequent development may be disturbed .",
            "The question is , how early and where .",
            "Dr. Patricia M. Rodier , an embryologist at the University of Rochester School of Medicine , believes that the brain glitch in autism occurs between days 20 and 24 of gestation , before a woman knows she is pregnant .",
            "She has evidence that genes involved in laying down basic body and brain structures , called hox genes , are mutated in autism .",
            "Dr. Margaret L. Bauman , a neurologist at Harvard Medical School , believes that the defect may occur before the middle of the second trimester of pregnancy .",
            "She bases this theory on her extensive knowledge of how and when certain circuits are wired .",
            "Some cells can be `` missing '' only if the defect occurs midway in fetal development , she said .",
            "But Dr. Eric Courchesne , a neuroscientist at the University of California at San Diego , said that the problem could just as easily occur after a baby is born and as the brain continues to develop .",
            "In October , researchers identified the precise genetic defect in a disorder , Rett 's syndrome , that was once commonly misdiagnosed as autism .",
            "Babies are born and develop normally until they are between about 6 months and 24 months old , when a gene that represses other genes fails to shut down as it should .",
            "As a result , the other genes do not swing into action and children stop growing , wring their hands and become mentally retarded .",
            "Courchesne and other researchers believe a similar process may be at work in autism .",
            "Like other brain researchers , scientists who study autism were startled by recent discoveries that the human brain continues to make new brain cells _ not just new connections , as was previously thought _ well into adulthood .",
            "In fact , one scientist has evidence that the number of neurons in the human brain doubles between birth and 6 years .",
            "If this is true , Courchesne said , the child 's brain would be undergoing a huge amount of construction created by the interplay of genes and environment .",
            "It might be , he said , that disturbances in this construction give rise to autism .",
            "nn This theory is supported , some researchers say , by the fact that a quarter of autistic children appear normal until age 14-22 months and then experience the sudden onset of autistic symptoms , said Dr. Nancy J. Minshew , a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh .",
            "The onset may be caused by a malfunction in one or more genes , she said .",
            "Or it could be set off by something in the environment interacting with a genetically vulnerable child .",
            "Since 1983 , Dr. Bauman and her colleagues have been studying brain tissue obtained in autopsies from autistic children and adults .",
            "While large areas of the 11 brains they studied look normal , she said , the brains are generally bigger and heavier than most .",
            "Most important , there are abnormalities in three major regions that help control social behavior .",
            "Parts of the frontal lobes , which enable decision-making and planning , are thicker than normal .",
            "Cells in the limbic system , where emotions are processed , are a third smaller than normal and are found in excessive numbers .",
            "The cells are also immature , with stunted connections .",
            "Cells in the cerebellum _ a structure that helps in making predictions about what will happen next in terms of movements , thoughts and emotions _ are reduced by 30 percent to 50 percent .",
            "Symptoms of autism can be traced to problems in each of these regions , said Amaral , the neuroscientist at UC-Davis .",
            "For example , neurons in the amygdala respond to faces and the angle of gaze .",
            "Autistic children tend to ignore facial expressions , or at least do not seem to read them well .",
            "Experiments show that autistic children can use their cerebellums to shift attention when they are not paying attention to a particular task .",
            "But when they are asked to make a conscious decision about changing attention , a task that activates their frontal lobes , they can no longer to do the task , presumably because a larger circuit is engaged .",
            "Animal studies also shed light on the biology of social behavior relevant to autism , Amaral said .",
            "For example , monkeys have brain cells that respond to moving hands and faces but not other moving things .",
            "They have cells , called mirror neurons , that fire when the monkey performs an action , like gripping a handle bar , but also when the monkey observes another monkey performing the same action .",
            "They have cells that are activated by sights and sounds generated by others but not by the same sights and sounds when they are self-generated .",
            "Perhaps the human equivalent of these specialized cells are not functioning properly in autism .",
            "Experiments conducted on human autistic children suggest that very specific elements of social behavior are abnormal .",
            "For example , autistic children can use sabotage , but not deception , to prevent another person from attaining a goal .",
            "They can use communicative gestures , like `` come here , '' to affect another person 's behavior but not expressive gestures , like `` well done , '' to affect another 's mental state .",
            "They can feel the basic pleasure in mastering a task but not the pride , said Dr. Chris Frith , a neuroscientist at University College London in England .",
            "An emotion like pride requires taking into account other people 's expectations , he said .",
            "Another set of recent but not yet published experiments shows that autistic children are bombarded by their own nervous systems , making them more sensitive to stimuli , not less , said Portia Iverson , the founder of Cure Autism Now , a parent group based in Los Angeles , who is an expert on the disorder .",
            "`` If you hook a normal person up to a device that measures arousal and make direct eye contact , '' she said , `` you 'd see maybe four spikes a minute .",
            "In the same setting , the autistic child has a dozen or more spikes per minute , plus the peaks are extremely high and low , more severe and erratic .",
            "It 's like you or I would feel during an earthquake , but they feel that way all day long , '' she said .",
            "In normal learning and memory , Ms. Iverson said , people encode new information about 30 seconds after getting an arousal peak .",
            "`` But what if you have six times too many peaks ? ''",
            "she asked .",
            "`` You might encode enormous amounts of highly irrelevant information , focusing on details that do n't matter to the rest of us . ''",
            "Autism researchers agree that it will take many years before the genetics and neurochemistry of the disorder are understood .",
            "In the meantime , intensive one-on-one therapies that teach children how to control their movements and interact socially succeed in 30 percent to 50 percent of treated children , provided they start early , ideally by age 2 or 3 .",
            "The goal is to intercept the miswiring of the autistic brain and , as the brain is developing , help it grow the connections it needs .",
            "Still , for a great many austistic children , the disorder is not diagnosed until age 5 or 6 , when they start school , Dr. Bristol-Power said .",
            "Most pediatricians and family doctors still believe that autism is a relatively rare disorder and are not trained to pick up symptoms , she said .",
            "Any child that is not speaking in short phrases by age 2 should be evaluated .",

            "Now a new theory is triggering desperate parents ' interest -- and this time the stakes are higher because it could spur misuse of the nation 's most precious antibiotic , vancomycin .",
            "An Illinois mother persuaded scientists to try a bizarre-sounding experiment , testing whether vancomycin might help her son 's severe autism .",
            "To their surprise , little Andrew Bolte got better .",

            "Neuropsychological testing concluded that 10 children improved , he reports in this month 's Journal of Child Neurology -- but only for a while .",
            "And that 's the problem : Andrew and the others worsened again after just a few months .",
            "Yet already parents are calling doctors about vancomycin .",

            "Thirty-six doctors scoffed .",
            "After all , autism typically appears between ages 14 and 22 months , and no sufferers have ever been found with neurotoxic infections .",
            "Sandler called it `` highly improbable , '' too , but he tried because Andrew , by now 3 , was miserable .",

            "Aggression and other symptoms soon returned .",
