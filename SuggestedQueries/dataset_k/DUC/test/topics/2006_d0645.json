            "`` The state of housing in America is very , very good , '' said Nicolas Retsinas , director of Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies , which was releasing the study today .",

            "At the same time , however , the housing boom has n't done much for minorities and the working poor .",
            "Although more minorities are buying homes because of low interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan programs , the gap between white and nonwhite home ownership widened from 1994 to 1998 , the study found .",
            "Education is a factor in that gap .",
            "For minorities , the likelihood of becoming a homeowner increases dramatically with the completion of a bachelor 's degree , Retsinas said .",

            "The report by the University of Massachusetts ' Donahue Institute , concludes that one out of every four households in Massachusetts _ renters and homeowners alike _ are contending with a `` severe housing affordability problem , '' with a number facing homelessness , eviction or foreclosure .",
            "`` This is the first statewide study on housing that has been done in more than decade , '' said Aaron Gornstein , executive director of the Citizens ' Housing and Planning Association , which sponsored the study .",
            "The report 's focus is on people like Theresa Shenett , who wonders whether she will soon be spending the holidays in a homeless shelter .",

            "A major part of the problem , say housing advocates and policymakers , is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts .",

            "According to the study , evictions increased by 64 percent from 1993 to 1997 , and the state also has experienced a 100 percent increase in the number of homeless families since 1990 .",

            "Even those who 've managed to hold on to their homes are having a tough time making ends meet , the study found , characterizing about 36 percent of all renters in the state as `` shelter poor , '' meaning they ca n't really afford the amount they pay for housing , based on their total income and expenses .",
            "The study also found that while minority home buying has helped to push the state 's homeownership rate to about 62.3 percent , minority mortgage applicants still face rampant discrimination .",
            "In 1997 , denial rates for black and Latino applicants were 53 percent and 38 percent , while the denial rate for whites was just 26 percent .",
            "Moreover , upper-income black and Latino applicants were denied mortgages at twice the rate of whites in the same income bracket .",

            "Because the legislation would make some of the largest changes to federal housing policy in many years , the negotiations have often bogged down over political and symbolic issues .",

            "The trust , which the Massachusetts Democrat said can be funded by annual revenues of the Federal Housing Administration , would be used to help create rental housing for low- and moderate-income families , and to expand elderly housing and homeownership programs across the nation .",
            "The trust fund proposal to create affordable housing is the centerpiece of an address Kerry is scheduled to deliver Tuesday night at the 32nd annual dinner of the Citizens ' Housing and Planning Association Inc. ( CHAPA ) in Boston .",
            "A spokesman at Kerry 's office said the senator , who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate 's housing subcommittee , will work to build bipartisan support for the legislation to establish the trust fund , which he expects to introduce at the next session of Congress .",
            "`` The truth is , housing is the forgotten stepchild in the policy debate at the national level , '' Kerry said in a prepared statement .",
            "He said the federal government `` has to begin to again play a more aggressive role in increasing ( housing ) supply . ''",
            "During the 1980s , the federal government helped build an average of 128,000 affordable housing units per year , but that number fell to just 53,000 affordable units per year in the 1990s , according to CHAPA .",
            "Worse , Kerry 's office noted , the declining federal commitment has come at a time of soaring rents and real estate prices _ a situation that is especially acute in Massachusetts _ and in the face of a rapidly growing elderly population .",
            "In Massachusetts , there are about 130,000 low-income families living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs , with as many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing units , officials said .",
            "Those numbers do not include tens of thousands of moderate-income families in need of affordable housing .",
            "Housing advocates Monday applauded Kerry 's housing trust fund proposal .",
            "They said his position on the Senate Housing subcommitteee , combined with growing calls for affordable housing from local officials , would give the proposal high visibility in the next session of Congress .",
            "`` There 's a huge shortage of rental housing for families and the elderly .",
            "We need to do something to address that shortage , and this proposal does , '' said Aaron Gornstein , executive director of CHAPA , which is one of the region 's most respected nonprofit housing groups .",
            "`` I think it 's a realistic , practical proposal , '' he said .",
            "The centerpiece of Kerry 's plan calls for creation of a new national housing trust , set up much like the federal highway trust fund , which would take revenues generated by the FHA and reserve them for use exclusively in federal housing initiatives .",
            "Congressional sources and housing officials said Monday the FHA generates about $ 2 billion annually from insurance guarantees it provides as one of the nation 's largest mutual mortgage funds , and from related sources .",
            "Officials said Monday the $ 2 billion was in excess of reserves the FHA is required to set aside .",
            "The money currently goes into the nation 's general fund .",
            "According to an outline of the proposal , many of the legislative efforts would be directed toward helping local and state governments build affordable housing and boost the rate of homeownership through an array of existing , but underfunded , programs .",
            "Nicholas Retsinas , director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and a former head of the FHA , said Kerry 's proposal was a `` noteworthy '' way of addressing the shortage of affordable housing .",

            "It 's a growing problem , and it 's not going to go away , '' Retsinas said .",

            "It was not a particularly exciting topic , and several in the crowd fell asleep during his remarks .",
            "But it highlighted Lazio 's mainstay in Congress since 1994 , an area of expertise rarely associated with Republicans , in which he is widely credited with working on both sides of the political aisle .",
            "Yet Clinton challenges the effectiveness and outcomes of Lazio 's work on public housing and welfare reform .",
            "Some of the mandates to come out of the Republican-led Congress _ and , particularly , out of the House Banking and Financial Services ' housing subcommittee that Lazio chairs _ are described by the first lady 's campaign as `` draconian '' measures that would eliminate public housing for some of America 's poorest people .",
            "In his first campaign policy speech _ and one of the only ones _ Lazio envisioned publicly financed communities of people with diverse incomes .",
            "He also spoke enthusiastically about giving states more power over federal aid , a familiar Republican theme .",
            "`` We want people who are working next to people who are n't working , '' Lazio said .",
            "`` We do n't want to concentrate poverty .",

            "In 1998 , after two years of work on the idea , Lazio successfully pushed through Congress revisions to the nation 's public housing law , which had not been substantially updated since 1937 .",
            "The law , hailed as one of the Republicans ' most significant legislative successes of the 1990s , was signed into law by President Clinton .",

            "Such a stand , critics have said , hints at the conservative credentials Lazio adopted when the Republicans took over Congress in 1994 , despite his apparent moderate change of heart .",
            "For example , Lazio voted for a `` Contract With America '' provision that would have severely limited Medicaid , part of an overall rolling back of subsidized benefits in the push to overhaul the welfare system .",
            "He eventually voted for the Welfare-to-Work bill signed into law in 1996 by President Clinton after the White House rejected two welfare reform bills approved by Congress .",
            "The first lady , too , supports the Welfare-to-Work law , although she has said it has not been wholly successful everywhere .",

            "`` Clearly some places in the country are doing it a lot better than other places . ''",
            "Clinton also lashed out at Lazio last month for what she said was his refusal to expand a Federal Housing Authority insurance program that would have made it easier for more first-time home buyers to secure mortgages .",
