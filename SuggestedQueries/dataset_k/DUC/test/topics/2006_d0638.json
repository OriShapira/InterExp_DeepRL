            "According to their model , Europa 's ocean tides must rise and fall some 100 feet , compared with Earth tides of about 4 to 6 feet .",
            "Europa 's slightly eccentric orbit , the scientists said , contribute to the tidal forces that created the cycloid shapes of the fracture lines .",
            "When Europa is closer to Jupiter , the tides are higher because the planet 's gravitational tug is greater .",
            "When Europa is farther away , the tides fall .",
            "This causes Europa 's ice shell to flex and crack .",
            "The crack would propagate slowly across the ever-changing stress field , describing an arc .",
            "The scientists using the model say each arc segment in the scalloped lines forms in 3.5 days , which happens to be the time it takes Europa to make one complete orbit around Jupiter .",
            "Each arc ranges from 45 miles to 120 miles in length .",
            "In a telephone interview , Hoppa , of the university 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson , said , `` The only way this model works is if there is a significant water layer below the ice .",
            "Only if there is a liquid water ocean could there be tides that would account for the surface features we see . ''",
            "Other members of the Arizona team are Dr. B. Randall Tufts , Dr. Richard Greenberg and Dr. Paul Geissler .",
            "The scientists caution that the findings do not necessarily mean there is still a liquid ocean under Europa 's ice , only that there was one there when the surface markings were formed .",
            "Other planetary scientists agreed , but noted that the relative absence of cratering on Europa indicated that the strong ocean tidal forces must have existed in the recent past .",
            "They could not think of any obvious reason why the liquid ocean would have disappeared in recent times .",
            "Dr. Ronald Greeley of Arizona State University in Tempe , a member of the Galileo science team , said , `` The likelihood is that , yes , there are liquid oceans on Europa , but we ca n't say that definitively with the information available now . ''",
            "Because of increasing interest in Europa 's watery past or present , NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in 2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008 .",
            "Its remote-sensing instruments are to include ice-penetrating radar to establish once and for all if there are still oceans on Europa ."

            "& UR ; ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & LR ; & QC ; For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen , fractured surface of Jupiter 's moon Europa .",
            "Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a Europan sea , in the form of salt deposits on the moon 's icy surface .",
            "The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles below the ice .",
            "The evidence also suggests that Europa 's ocean is highly carbonated .",
            "Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the moon 's face .",
            "The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer , which measures the absorption and reflection of various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa 's surface .",
            "Each material absorbs and reflects different , characteristic wavelengths of light .",
            "The wavelengths measured by Galileo 's spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of Europa 's surface .",
            "When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice , it indeed measured the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there .",
            "But when the instrument examined features like the many dark lines that crisscross the moon 's surface , it obtained several distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice .",
            "Thomas McCord , a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is studying the Galileo data , recognized that the spectra were produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals , including natron and Epsom salts .",
            "Such salts , McCord says , form only in the presence of liquid water .",
            "`` This is the first evidence that Europa 's ocean is briny , '' McCord says .",
            "The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have recorded .",
            "Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon .",
            "Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at different sites scattered about the moon , evidence that the sea is extensive and well mixed .",
            "The composition of the salts , McCord says , gives some hints about the chemistry of Europa 's ocean .",
            "The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is probably dissolved in the water .",
            "On Earth , volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release carbon dioxide , `` so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide gas would be coming out of Europa 's mantle and into the ocean , '' McCord says .",
            "`` The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time , so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer water . ''",
            "Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it could erupt through the ice to the surface .",
            "( This could explain the origin of volcano-like features on Europa . )",
            "Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon 's surface , the briny water would quickly evaporate , leaving the salts behind .",
            "As yet , there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor .",
            "`` But if there is an ocean , there has to be heat coming out of the mantle , '' McCord says , `` so there almost have to be hydrothermal vents . ''",
            "There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents could n't exist in oceans on worlds other than our own .",
            "In fact , the Mars Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near Mars ' equator .",
            "If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large ancient body of hot water , it would be an ideal place to search for past life on Mars .",
            "A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life .",
            "But unlike Mars , Europa may still harbor some kind of life .",
            "`` It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile environment for the formation of life on Earth , '' McCord says .",
            "Carbonates create a less acidic environment , one more favorable for life .",
            "`` Here we have , perhaps , a carbon dioxide-rich ocean .",
            "It 's one more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for life . ''",

            "A probe that plummeted into Jupiter 's atmosphere late in 1995 , sampling its composition for the first time , found more than twice the concentration of volatile elements like argon and nitrogen than expected , raising questions about standard theories of how the planets formed .",
            "The results , which a team of scientists led by Dr. Tobias Owen of the University of Hawaii is reporting in Thursday 's issue of Nature , suggest that at least some of the rocky , icy bits of dust and ice that crashed together to form Jupiter _ cometlike bodies called planetesimals _ must have originated under cooler conditions than prevail in the region of the solar system where the planet orbits now .",
            "Otherwise the planetesimals would not have been cold enough to trap the volatile gases , which would have been dispersed among the other tenuous matter in interplanetary space .",
            "The observations , some researchers said , could mean that some planetesimals rained down on the forming planet from the colder , outer reaches of the solar system that are farther from the warmth of the sun .",
            "Other planetary scientists suggested that the results imply that the whirling disk of dust , gas and rock in the young solar system , called the solar nebula , simply shaded the sun 's light more than expected in standard theories .",
            "There is even the bizarre possibility that Jupiter formed as much as 10 times farther from the sun than it is now , and somehow lumbered inward to its present position .",
            "Most scientists dismissed that possibility as extremely unlikely , but said the results nevertheless posed a challenge for theories of planet formation .",
            "`` The specific pattern they find is puzzling , '' said Dr. Jonathan I. Lunine , a professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona , `` and it seems to require that the planetesimals that carried these materials into Jupiter came from very , very cold regions . ''",

            "Other scientists said the new findings , reported in the current issue of the journal Nature , appeared to solve the mystery of how Jupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather system , although many questions remain unanswered .",
            "A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell University found the most telling evidence in images , from visible and infrared light , of the south equatorial belt , a region west of Jupiter 's Great Red Spot , a seemingly permanent storm in the southern hemisphere .",
            "Lightning was visible there before dawn .",
            "A few hours later , a cluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there .",
            "The scientists estimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms corresponded to the flux generated by the planet 's internal heat source .",
            "`` We therefore conclude that moist convection is a dominant factor in converting heat flow into kinetic energy in the Jovian atmosphere , '' Gierasch 's group wrote .",
            "In another report , a group led by Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the lightning preceding the storms was a critical clue indicating the presence of large amounts of water in the deep clouds .",
            "Nothing else , they noted , could condense at depths of as much as 60 miles below the upper layer of the atmosphere .",
            "`` So we can use lightning as a beacon that points to the place where there are rapidly falling raindrops and rapidly rising air columns _ a source of energy for the eddies , '' Ingersoll explained .",
            "`` The eddies , in turn , get pulled apart by shear flow and give up their energy to these large-scale features .",
            "So ultimately , the Great Red Spot gets its energy and stays alive by eating these eddies . ''",
            "On Earth , violent storms like hurricanes and cyclones are fueled by the warm ocean .",
            "The water is heated by sunlight , which drives all terrestrial weather .",
            "But Jupiter is 5 times farther from the Sun than is Earth and sunlight is only 4 percent as strong there as on Earth , not enough to generate the observed tempests .",
            "Scientists have long assumed that Jupiter 's internal heat somehow churns the thick atmosphere .",
            "Because of the heat reservoir of highly compressed hydrogen at its core , the planet generates nearly 70 percent more heat than it absorbs from the Sun .",
            "But how did that heat rise from the depths to drive Jovian weather ?",
            "Moist convection had been proposed as the mechanism , said Dr. Alvin Seiff of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View , Calif. , but there was no firm evidence until now .",
            "In an accompanying journal article , Seiff said the new research represented `` a notable advance in our knowledge of Jupiter 's weather by demonstrating that moist convection occurs and transports significant amounts of energy . ''",
            "But he said , `` Much work remains for us to gain a broad description of Jupiter 's fluid behavior . ''",
            "One remaining uncertainty is what circulation is like deeper below the outer layers of the planet 's thick clouds ."
