            "Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky .",
            "But a review of more than 100 perjury cases in state and federal courts , and statistics on the number of perjury prosecutions brought around the country , show that people are prosecuted in America for what might be called small lies more regularly than the Clinton defenders have suggested .",

            "But interviews with lawyers , legal experts and with a woman who is serving a sentence for lying about sex in a civil case show that , far from being shrugged off , the threat of prosecution for perjury , even in civil cases , is a crucial deterrent in the legal system .",
            "`` Symbolically , the sword of Damocles hangs over every perjurer 's head , and no one can know whether they 're the perjurer that 's going to be prosecuted , '' said Jeffrey Abramson , a former prosecutor and an expert on jury trials who is a professor of legal studies and politics at Brandeis University .",
            "One statistic on perjury prosecutions has been widely circulated since the president 's supporters began arguing that perjury was little more than a technicality seized upon by the president 's enemies : Of 49,655 cases filed by federal prosecutors last year , only 87 were for perjury .",

            "Perjury charges are brought in civil cases far less frequently than in criminal cases .",
            "In addition , the law of perjury is highly technical , with courts sometimes ruling that some obviously misleading statements like those Clinton acknowledges making may not constitute perjury under the law .",
            "But the cases also show that , even in civil cases , judges are sometimes provoked by perjury more than by many of the evils they see every day .",

            "In 1990 , Holland was convicted of perjury for lying about his assets so the plaintiffs could not recover any of the $ 450,000 in damages they had won .",

            "The judge sentenced Holland to home detention and community service .",
            "But in 1994 , a federal appeals court criticized that ruling and sent the case back for a sterner sentence .",

            "He 's a big man , white haired , avuncular .",
            "But he did not seem a clear natural for the Microsoft trial .",
            "Jackson is hardly a technophile ; he has been known to write opinions longhand .",
            "And while the fast moving world of technology demanded an equally fast-paced trial , Jackson got in trouble once for allowing a trial to go on too long _ so long , in fact , that the Court of Appeals ordered him to rule .",
            "But lawyers said he administered the Microsoft trial brilliantly .",
            "It was by far the most prominent , and probably the most important trial of his career .",
            "And he got through it winning plaudits from both sides for the innovative procedures that allowed testimony to be completed in less than a year , when most major antitrust trials have typically run on for nearly a decade .",
            "What is more , as the trial proceeded , his knowledge of the computer industry grew ; he asked more and more technical questions that demonstrated an ever firmer grasp .",
            "Jackson once told a group of reporters who happened to share a cab with him toward the end of the trial that he tried hard to sit Sphinx-like on the bench , so no one could read anything into his expressions .",
            "But at that one thing , at least , he failed .",
            "Anyone watching could see when he was bored , when he was captivated by the testimony , when he was angry and when he was amused .",
            "Some judges put on expressions deliberately , to manipulate the audience .",
            "But Jackson seemed guileless .",
            "While he cautioned that no one should read anything into his questions , comments , smirks and shrugs , the tenor of his behavior usually left little doubt that Microsoft was not winning the day , or the trial .",
            "His findings of fact bore that out .",
            "And given his history , it is clear that he prepared them with attention and care .",
            "The Court of Appeals rebuked him last year by overturning a previous ruling in a related Microsoft case .",
            "That was hardly the judge 's only reproval from the higher court .",
            "But his findings of fact are almost bulletproof by their very nature .",
            "Appeals courts essentially have no standing to question his judgments about the credibility of the testimony before him .",
            "And if , as expected , the conclusions of law and verdict hew closely to these findings of fact , the judge 's eventual ruling is more likely to withstand appeals .",
            "Thomas Penfield Jackson was born in 1937 and grew up in Kensington , Md. , a pleasant , leafy , middle-class suburb of Washington with Victorian homes and its own sense of community .",
            "His father , Thomas Searing Jackson , was a prominent Washington lawyer who started his own firm , Jackson & AMP ; Campbell .",

            "After graduation , he spent three years in the Navy , most of it aboard a destroyer in the Mediterranean , and then attended Harvard Law School .",
            "Soon after , he joined his father 's firm as a civil and criminal litigator .",
            "Among other cases , he defended several medical organizations charged with malpractice and was often described as a tenacious litigator .",
            "Along the way , he became politically active in Montgomery County , an area so heavily Democratic that Republicans like Jackson were ciphers .",

            "He came to the attention of the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon , which he served as a lawyer in 1972 _ and avoided any taint from Watergate .",

            "But he was not chosen , and some lawyers at the time said he was not selected because of his membership in the Chevy Chase Country Club , which accepted no black members .",
            "Whether or not that was the reason , his membership was probably viewed as impolitic for a judge presiding over trials of District residents , most of whom were black .",

Deaver , the former top Reagan aide who was convicted of lying under oath during an investigation of whether he had improperly lobbied former White House associates .",

            "Rasheeda Moore , the former model who was used to lure Barry to a hotel room where he was videotaped smoking crack , referred several times on the tape to `` Jell-O . ''",
            "Spectators and reporters wondered if that was a code word for drugs , but neither the prosecution nor the defense thought to ask .",
            "So Jackson spoke up to ask : Was Jell-O a secret word for drugs ?",
            "`` No , unh-unh , '' Ms. Moore replied ; she was merely talking about dessert .",
            "Jackson may not have believed that .",
            "In fact he had trouble with the trial .",
            "Shortly after it ended , he complained in a speech to the Harvard Law Forum that he thought `` four jurors were determined to acquit regardless of the facts , '' adding that `` they obviously did not tell the truth during jury selection when questioned about possible bias . ''",
            "Jackson went on to say that the government had put on a very strong case .",
            "In 1995 , the local paper Legal Times sent a reporter to spend a day in his courtroom , to check stories floating around that he was slow-moving .",
            "The reporter wrote that he took a two-hour lunch and three `` 10-minute '' breaks that each lasted half an hour .",
            "All in all , the judge had spent 3 hours and 4 minutes on the bench , the reporter wrote , while his breaks lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes .",
            "During the Microsoft trial , the judge scheduled a 90-minute lunch break every day that usually lasted about 110 minutes .",
            "And he had regular breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon , each of which lasted about 20 minutes .",
            "Trial opened at 10 a.m. and generally adjourned for the day about 4:20 , though sometimes it went as late as 5 p.m .",
            "So , generally , Jackson spent about four hours on the bench , three hours on breaks .",
            "And given the highly technical nature of the testimony , that was probably as much as he or anyone else could handle .",
            "No one complained .",
            "nn While on the bench , he gave the lawyers for both sides great leeway to conduct their examinations as they chose , usually overruling objections and only occasionally prodding the lawyers to hurry up when he thought the examinations were plodding along in a way that was of little use to him .",
            "This was appropriate since he was hearing the case without a jury .",
            "In his spare time , Jackson sails on the Chesapeake Bay and reads , both fiction and nonfiction .",
            "He has been married three times and has two grown daughters and two granddaughters .",
            "His wife , Pat , is director of development at Sidwell Friends , a prep school in Washington .",
            "The Microsoft trial , of course , gave the judge more exposure , more attention in the press , than he had ever had before .",
            "He plainly was not comfortable with that .",
            "In 1997 he wrote a commentary for a judicial conference that showed his view of the news media .",
            "`` The relationship between a potentially newsworthy case and the press is roughly comparable to the relationship between a healthy organism and an infectious disease , '' he wrote , adding : `` The press , like all infectious diseases , is a predator .",
