            "He embodies the best about his gritty generation , the one that triumphed in World War II and then built the world 's greatest economy .",
            "But do n't let the glowing descriptions you 'll hear from young TV reporters lead you to believe that goodwill toward older Americans is universal .",
            "Despite the family ties that bind us , the different generations seem to be growing apart as jealousy and economic conflict drive wedges between the various age groups .",
            "Many members of Glenn 's generation believe they are losing ground financially now .",
            "At the same time , their children are getting sick of paying high taxes to support Social Security .",
            "And Generation Xers are afraid the baby boomers ahead of them soon will create such a huge voting bloc of retirees that Congress will be pushed to further boost taxes to support the elderly .",
            "Each generation has some legitimate gripes and fears .",
            "Today 's over-65 Americans are frustrated because they are seeing their income decline at a time when younger people are flourishing .",
            "While jobs are plentiful and mortgages cheap for workers in the prime of life , retirees are getting pinched by a meager 1.3 percent cost-of-living increase in Social Security payments and a continuing decline in the interest rates paid on savings .",
            "With their incomes stagnant or shrinking , many older Americans are getting angry with their children .",

            "But while senior citizens are complaining about `` selfish '' children , boomers are getting fed up with the kvetching of their parents , who are getting far more out of Social Security than they put into it .",
            "In the 1950s , the combined payroll tax for Social Security , paid by both workers and their employers , was just 6 percent .",
            "Today , the combined tax is 12.4 percent .",
            "The World War II generation had nowhere near the tax burden that today 's workers carry to fund benefits for aging veterans , Social Security , Medicare and other programs for the elderly .",
            "Largely because of that government aid , the elderly are the wealthiest demographic group in America .",
            "But perhaps no generation has more to fear from their elders than Generation X , the people born from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s .",
            "Those young workers are vastly outnumbered by the boomers who were born between 1946 and 1964 .",
            "GenXers may find themselves suffocated by much higher taxes to care for long-living boomers .",
            "Economists estimate that to maintain today 's level of Social Security benefits , workers in 2020 will have to shoulder a 20 percent payroll tax .",
            "In 1999 , Congress is supposed to take up Social Security reform .",
            "The arguments could get very ugly as each generation tries to cut a better deal for itself .",
            "For decades , the most bitter battles in American social and political life were over race .",
            "In coming years , the most hostile debates may be over what one generation owes another .",

            "He certainly did n't know that gray would become the new black .",
            "Nonetheless , hip is how a new breed of Goodwill shoppers has come to consider the retail stores .",
            "Due in part to Generation X 's preternatural nostalgia for all things from the '70s ( and '80s and even early '90s , it seems ) and thanks to image-building efforts from the organization itself , Goodwill is n't just for people with `` special needs '' anymore .",
            "`` I was Goodwill before Goodwill was cool , '' says local twentysomething bohemian Bret McCabe .",
            "`` I 've been going there for about a decade .",
            "My shopping technique , wherever I 've lived , is to find the poorest neighborhood and to go there .",
            "You avoid places where hipsters go because they 'll sift through everything and get the good stuff .",
            "They wo n't go to the poor neighborhood . ''",
            "Like most Goodwillers , McCabe speaks lovingly of a favorite find .",
            "`` It was an early '70s-era purple , shiny three-piece suit , with , like , huge lapels .",
            "It had a sheen to it , '' he says .",
            "`` I paid about $ 1.50 or $ 2 .",
            "But I gave it to a friend because it looked better on him .",
            "He had an Afro . ''",
            "McCabe does admit to having `` special needs , '' but not the sort that Goodwill has strived to meet for almost a century .",
            "The nonprofit organization uses revenues from its stores to fund community-based training and job-placement programs for people who otherwise might slip through the cracks .",
            "Last year , Goodwill Industries served more than 200,000 people through training and job placement and sold nearly $ 690 million in donated goods .",
            "Erin Quillian , the director of sales for Goodwill Industries of Fort Worth , says her organization got its groove back by focusing on retail display in the stores .",
            "`` I think a lot of it really has to do with changing our image and the way we present ourselves , '' she says .",
            "`` We 're not what people typically think a thrift store is .",
            "It 's surprising to a lot of people , when they first come in , that we look just like any other store . ''",
            "Quillian says the national trend within Goodwill is to recruit store managers who have retail experience , people who `` really know how to set up a store and really create some excitement in it . ''",
            "Quillian herself worked at Ross Dress For Less and Dillard 's before coming to Goodwill .",
            "But perhaps the most surprising thing about Goodwill is not that bohemian hipsters snatch up the retro threads hanging on its well-displayed racks , but that the decidedly downscale shop founded by a Methodist minister is actually shaping the future of upscale fashion .",
            "Doubters need look no further than the Dallas-based design firm William Reid .",
            "William Reid 's fall line graces such high-end shops as Stanley Korshak , Takashimaya and Saks Fifth Avenue .",
            "Reid is so hip that sources say he knows what the new gray is _ or at least has a good idea .",
            "And , as it turns out , he shops Goodwill for inspiration .",
            "`` It 's almost like a fashion library , '' Reid says .",
            "`` I go in there just looking for things that are very unusual , whether it 's details or fabrics or certain silhouettes that you ca n't explain to someone .",
            "We find a lot of old ties , and we 'll take a pattern of that tie and put it in the computer and play with it a little bit and make it into shirts and all sorts of things . ''",
            "In fact , Reid has found clothes at Goodwill whose sartorial splendor has stymied the finest craftsmen of Italy .",
            "Only a few weeks ago , he bought a jacket for $ 15 .",
            "`` It was a leather jacket that had this braiding stitched around the cuff , '' he remembers fondly .",
            "`` It was so unusual .",
            "We immediately sent it over to our manufacturers and said , ` How difficult is it to do this ? '",
            "They laughed and said they could n't touch it .",

            "Whether the rest of Mexico will go along is another question .",
            "`` For me , this is a social movement , '' said Ana Paula Lira , a 19-year-old dentistry student , as she stood guard at the gate of one of the now-barricaded entrances to the vast Mexico City campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico , or UNAM .",

            "Late into the night , they play chess and talk politics .",
            "During the days , they hold protests , teach children 's theater and modern dance in their own open university , and try to convince commuters on buses and the city 's subway that there is something fundamentally wrong with the direction Mexico is going on the cusp of the 21st century .",
            "`` We just do n't want to change the university _ what we want is a social movement that will help the people , '' Lira said .",
            "The protest has shut down Latin America 's largest university for more than 3 months and forced most of its 276,000 students and 30,000 professors to go off campus for classes .",
            "Frustrated university officials finally canceled the spring semester earlier this month .",
            "But as a social movement , the strike has a particular problem : Nobody , including the strikers , seems to know exactly what they want .",
            "Unlike the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas , which initially drew wide sympathy from the left and the country 's urban poor , Mexican society has an ambivalent relationship with its new revolutionaries .",

            "`` I say the ones who want to study should study and the rest , throw them out in the street . ''",
            "Even so , nearly everyone has been surprised by the determination of the students and a capacity to organize that has repeatedly brought supportive crowds of thousands into the capital 's streets and the university 's main square .",
            "The strike appears to have tapped the frustration of a generation that has grown up as Mexico has stumbled from one economic crisis to another .",
            "Real wages have dropped dramatically since the early 1980s , analysts say , and the inequality gap that separates rich from poor has grown .",
            "`` This is a moment when some sectors of society feel alienated , and the youth are reacting to that , '' said Sergio Aguayo , a political analyst .",
            "`` Forty to 50 percent of this country lives in poverty . ''",
            "That may explain why the strikers did n't stop June 7 , when the university 's president gave in to their primary demand and withdrew his proposal for a mandatory increase in fees from the current equivalent of about 2 cents per semester _ effectively free _ to about $ 150 .",
            "The students had won , but they had also captured the public pulpit and seemed unwilling to give it up .",
            "They have added several more demands , including a restructuring of how the university is governed .",
            "But it is also clear from interviews with students and their faculty supporters that many hope the strike can spark a nationwide political movement that can connect with workers , primary and secondary school teachers , and other universities _ invigorating the country 's left in a grand , grass-roots coalition .",
            "`` One of the engines of democratization in the country over the last 30 years has been the public university .",
            "That 's what you 're seeing now _ the university moving to recapture this national role , '' said Carola Garcia Calderon , a professor of communication in the faculty of political and social sciences , which has served as the movement 's nerve center .",
            "Yet not much agreement has emerged on what this larger movement ought to be about .",

            "Internal splits are already forming .",
            "After weeks of brewing dissent , a sizable group of students broke ranks July 18 over the issue of whether they should hand over the campus to help restart negotiations .",
            "In the end , the most significant thing about the students ' uprising may be that they can shut down a massive university , march in the streets , hand ultimatums to government negotiators and , through it all , give the authorities little choice but to stand by and wait it out .",
            "It 's a dramatic contrast to Mexico 's leftist student movement of 1968 that ended when federal troops opened fire on the protesters in a square , killing , by one estimate , nearly 200 .",
            "Private papers of the general who was Mexico 's secretary of defense at the time were made public last month .",
            "The documents show that members of the presidential bodyguard team fired on the students and that the order came directly from the president , Gustavo Diaz Ordaz , something long denied by successive governments .",

            "But whether he can keep the company in good health will depend in part on improving GM 's standing among consumers half his age .",
            "With rivals hustling harder for younger buyers , Wagoner will have to show that GM can compete profitably for those consumers and keep bringing them back as they grow older .",
