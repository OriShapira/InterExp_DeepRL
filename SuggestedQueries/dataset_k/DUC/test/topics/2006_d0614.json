            "The new legislation , which requires a `` clear majority '' voting on a `` clear question '' on secession , is the direct outgrowth of what many Canadians now call their nation 's `` near death experience , '' the 1995 Quebec referendum that unity forces won by a margin of just 1 percent .",
            "Since that high point for separation , polls in Quebec indicated this fall that support for independence receded to a 10-year low , around 40 percent .",
            "At the same time , popular support for the separatists ' provincial government , headed by Premier Lucien Bouchard , fell to the lowest point in its five-year history , around 37 percent .",
