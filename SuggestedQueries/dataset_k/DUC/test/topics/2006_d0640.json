            "MOSCOW ( AP ) -- With an honor guard in crisp blue uniforms standing at attention on the deck and its flags snapping in the breeze , the nuclear submarine Kursk glided silently out to sea , a symbol of Russian power and pride .",
            "It was the last time anyone on land would see the nuclear-powered warship that the Russian navy boasted was unsinkable .",
            "As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers , the Kursk 's crew expected to be home in a few days .",
            "The Kursk was named after the region in southern Russia where Soviet troops in 1943 turned the tide against Nazi Germany 's army in the biggest tank battle in history .",
            "Like the old land battle , the Kursk was intended to turn the tide at sea if there was ever another world war .",
            "The submarine was a 500-foot-long underwater missile base .",
            "Its sides bristled with 24 silos , each housing a cruise missile capable of slamming a nuclear warhead at supersonic speed into a target hundreds of miles away .",
            "The submarine and a dozen like it were designed during the Cold War to destroy the U.S. Navy 's aircraft carriers with swarms of missiles .",
            "The Cold War ended a decade ago and the Kursk 's nuclear warheads were locked up ashore .",
            "The Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia was falling apart , sinking deeper into poverty and backwardness .",
            "With most of its warships too dilapidated to put to sea , the navy staked what little money it had on keeping up the nuclear submarine fleet -- a potent threat that the navies of the United States and other Western nations could not ignore .",
            "The Kursk was just five years old .",
            "The crew , nearly half of them officers with advanced technical skills , had been hailed as the navy 's elite , a chosen few who could handle any challenge .",
            "President Vladimir Putin had big plans for the navy and the Kursk .",
            "The navy exercises that the Kursk sailed to join on Aug. 10 were a prelude for a major step in putting Moscow back on the world stage : the return of a Russian fleet to the Mediterranean in 2001 for the first time in a decade .",
            "The exercises were big news .",
            "Russian television showed film of the Northern Fleet in action , the hulking cruisers and nimble destroyers cutting through the waves and warships firing missiles .",
            "Then on Aug. 14 , a Monday , the navy announced that the Kursk had experienced a malfunction .",
            "The situation was not critical -- the submarine was in radio contact , air and power lines had been hooked up and arrangements were being made to bring the crew up , the navy said .",
            "Mounting evidence suggests the crewmen were already dead and almost every utterance by top officials about saving the Kursk would turn out to be untrue .",
            "The Kursk was rising to the surface , possibly preparing to fire a torpedo on Aug. 12 when disaster struck .",
            "Nothing is known about what the crew was doing in those last few moments .",
            "Norwegian monitors later reported detecting an explosion in the vicinity of the Kursk , followed within minutes by a much larger blast that registered at 3.5 on seismic monitors , equivalent to a small earthquake .",
            "All the signs suggest a problem in the torpedo compartment at the front of the Kursk .",
            "The submarine was carrying a new type of torpedo with a liquid fuel system that some officers complained was unstable , according to some reports .",
            "Or the young , inexperienced conscript sailors may have fumbled one of the torpedoes or the test firing may have gone wrong , the weapon jamming in a torpedo tube .",
            "The first blast must have convulsed the Kursk , knocking out control systems and pitching it into a sharp dive toward the bottom 350 feet below the waves .",
            "Crewmen would have been knocked sprawling as the submarine plunged out of control .",
            "Officers in the command center would have been shouting for reports , trying to determine what had happened .",
            "Maybe there was time to hit the alarm system , but the whole crew already knew they were in serious trouble .",
            "The first blast probably killed and injured some of the sailors .",
            "Survivors would have been shouting for help , for first aid crews , frantically trying to reach injured comrades .",
            "Plunging down at mounting speed and with the decks slanting sharply forward , sailors would have been fighting to stay on their feet or in their seats as the Kursk plunged into the depths .",
            "They never regained control .",
            "A second , catastrophic explosion ripped through the Kursk , probably as it slammed into the bottom .",
            "This blast was probably torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles detonating .",
            "Russia 's navy says it was about 2 tons of explosives going up ; some officers say it could have been more than 10 tons .",
            "The hull was twisted like a wet towel being squeezed dry .",
            "The Kursk was built of immensely strong steel to withstand the enormous pressures of diving hundreds of feet .",
            "The hull would have contained and intensified the explosion .",
            "Following the path of least resistance , the blast ripped backward , breaking through the thinner walls of the crew compartments .",
            "Most of the crew were within yards of the blast .",
            "Navy officers say that many were probably vaporized by the detonation ; others were ripped to bits .",
            "Anybody still alive after the second explosion was almost certainly stunned , probably deafened and unconscious .",
            "Kursk 's nuclear reactors appear to have shut down , plunging the submarine into darkness .",
            "The explosions ripped at least one large hole in the hull .",
            "Tons of water surged in , quickly filling the submarine .",
            "Anyone who survived the explosions almost certainly drowned , the navy says .",
            "There may never be an exact reconstruction of the last moments of the Kursk .",
            "It did not have black boxes like those which can tell what happened to a crashed airliner .",
            "Raising the Kursk may be impossible , meaning that its secrets will be lost forever ."

            "Reports from the northern port city of Murmansk , where the rescue efforts were headquartered , said Norwegian divers with video equipment have started to descend to Kursk Sunday morning in a final bid to find possible survivors aboard .",
            "However , Russian officials said Saturday that all 118 submariners were probably dead .",
            "The Norwegian and British teams were brought to the disaster site by two Norwegian ships which moved into position above the mangled Kursk before dawn .",
            "The divers , working at a depth of about 100 meters , would assess the damage suffered by the submarine when it sank August 12 , a task that would take `` several hours , '' a spokesman for the British Defense Ministry said .",
            "According to Russian reports , the divers would try to manually unscrew a lid leading to the sub 's escape chamber .",
            "Pressure- measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the rescue team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk .",
            "Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for survival .",
            "The divers would also assess chances for the British mini-submarine to latch on to the damaged escape hatch .",
            "The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on August 12 , slamming it to the bottom of the sea .",
            "The authorities said most of the Kursk 's crew apparently died in the first minutes of the disaster , and that any survivors likely drowned as the ship filled with water .",
            "`` Most possibly , we will have to admit that our worst expectations have materialized , '' Vice Admiral Mikhail Motsak , chief of the Northern Fleet , told a special program on RTR television in the starkest statement so far .",
            "Russian rescuers continued struggling to reach the submarine , but were hampered by powerful currents and near-zero visibility on the seabed .",
            "The escape hatch they were trying to reach at the rear of the submarine is badly damaged , and repeated efforts to dock have failed .",
            "There is still no final word on what caused the accident , but Motsak , the chief of the Northern Fleet , said there were three possible versions .",
            "The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on collision with another object .",
            "Motsak said three foreign submarines were spotted in the accident zone , which is an area under constant observation by foreign intelligence services .",
            "He said the Kursk 's collision detonated three or four torpedoes , resulting in a blast equivalent to 1-2 ton of TNT .",
            "The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent flooding of the sub 's first and second compartments .",
            "And the third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War II mine , the admiral said .",
            "The final suggestion should not be completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years , he added .",
            "Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov , who heads a government commission probing the causes of the accident , said the crewmembers in the first , second and possibly several subsequent compartments of the submarine died instantly when the Kursk struck the seabed Saturday .",
            "However , Klebanov said that there is still a chance that some sailors may still be alive in the eighth and ninth sections , but that this chance is more of a theoretical nature , Interfax reported .",
            "As the nation and the world pray for the sailors aboard the Kursk , the relatives of the submariners are having an especially hard time .",
            "The government has allocated funds to help those that have arrived at Murmansk and other places near the accident site .",
            "In one moving episode , the director of a train bound for Murmansk turned off the speakers of a carriage that housed the relatives of the Kursk crew -- to stop them from hearing radio broadcast of comments from military officials that the submariners ' chance of survival was almost zero .",

            "WASHINGTON _ Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk , another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port , carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia 's Navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea .",
            "The other submarine was the Memphis , a nuclear-powered attack submarine based in Groton , Conn. , and one of two American submarines spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12 .",
            "By the time the Memphis reached Bergen , Norway , officials in Russia had said that the Kursk probably had sunk after colliding with either a foreign submarine or a World War II mine .",
            "Publicly , the Pentagon still refuses to comment on the whereabouts or the mission of the Memphis , but some officials now acknowledge its spying mission .",
            "They insist that the Memphis was not damaged and that no other submarine was involved in any collision .",
            "The Memphis ' arrival in Norway was a long-scheduled liberty call , they said .",
            "The call allowed the submarine to unload sonar tapes and other recordings that the Americans say captured two explosions that ravaged and sank the Kursk , killing all 118 people on board .",
            "Those tapes , being analyzed at the National Maritime Intelligence Center in Suitland , Md. , contain the strongest evidence to support the leading American theory of what destroyed the Kursk .",
            "And that theory , they said , does not include the collision that the Russians have said probably occurred .",
            "`` We have subs that hear everything that goes on , '' a senior officer said .",
            "`` It 's pretty clear to us what happened . ''",
            "According to the American theory , a rocket-propelled torpedo being loaded or launched as part of an exercise misfired , its engine or its fuel exploding .",
            "After 2 minutes and 15 seconds _ during which time the Kursk 's captain either increased power from the nuclear reactor or blew ballast in an effort to surface _ a powerful explosion of the torpedo 's warhead tore a gaping hole in the submarine 's bow , killing most if not all of the crew instantly .",
            "In Vladivostok , Russia , a former submarine officer who is a member of a governmental commission investigating the explosion said Monday that a new weapons system was being tested on the Kursk .",
            "But the former officer , Sergei Zhekov , would not elaborate during a news conference about the system , saying that it was a state secret , the Interfax news agency reported .",

            "They detected no sounds of a collision .",
            "And they monitored the Russian fleet 's emergency radio transmissions closely in the aftermath .",

            "The Loyal is part of a class of surveillance ships that are operated by civilian contractors , but include as many as 15 Navy seamen and officers .",
            "According to the Navy , ships like the Loyal have only a single mission : `` to gather underwater acoustical data '' in support of `` the anti-submarine warfare mission '' of fleet commanders .",
            "Within hours of the explosions , the two American submarines radioed messages back to fleet headquarters .",
            "`` They were alive and well and had no bumps , '' another senior officer said .",
            "`` Not a tea cup was rattled , '' the senior military officer said .",

            "Ever since the Kursk sank , Russian accounts of what happened have been imprecise and sometimes contradictory .",
            "Officials in Russia did not report the accident until early Aug. 14 , which was a Monday , a day after they realized something went wrong and nearly two days after it happened .",
            "Even then they said that the accident had happened on Sunday , rather than on Saturday .",
            "The Russians do not deny that a major explosion hit the Kursk .",
            "But they have insisted that the submarine first was involved in a collision with some huge object , possibly a submarine or a World War II mine .",
            "American officials and submarine experts said it was possible that some of the crew _ perhaps 15 men or more _ survived the initial explosions if they managed quickly to shut the watertight doors to their compartments .",
            "The Russians said that they had detected tapping sounds from within the Kursk at least two days after it sank , raising hopes that a rescue of some crewmen might be possible .",
            "Some American officials said that neither the Loyal nor the American submarines detected the sounds , though they might not have been able to do so if they were too far away .",
            "While the Americans had a fair guess of what happened to the Kursk early on , it was only after the Memphis unloaded its sonar tapes on Aug. 18 that officials began to offer the theory of the misfiring of the torpedo missile .",
            "While the submarine 's sonar equipment allowed the crew to distinguish the explosions , a closer analysis of the recordings had to wait until the tapes reached shore .",
