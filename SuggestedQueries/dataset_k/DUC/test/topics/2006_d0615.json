            "Drawing on the deep resources of `` creation science '' advocacy groups , American fundamentalists are arming themselves with the latest books challenging details of Darwinian theory , getting elected to majority positions on school boards and learning ways to word curriculums so that creationism and evolution get equal respect .",
            "While they have gotten very good at making a case for teaching alternative theories , a small group of scientists and educators stands in their way .",
            "Most of America 's children are not being taught that the world might have come into existence only 10,000 years ago , versus the nearly 4.5 billion years advocated by scientists , and this is largely because of the SWAT-like efforts of the National Center for Science Education .",
            "The center , based in Berkeley , Calif. , has four full-time employees and 4,000 members .",
            "Within 24 hours of a call for help , Eugenie C. Scott , the executive director , jumps into action .",
            "Operating on a `` frayed , shoestring budget , '' the center can help mount a counterattack on creationism in public schools .",
            "The center supplies concise articles and pamphlets refuting the claims of creation science , legal advice and summaries of court cases involving creationism , tips on writing letters to the editors of local newspapers , advice on how to explain issues to reporters , phone numbers of national experts on evolution , links to dozens of organizations that can offer help , and the phone numbers of other people in their state who are willing to get involved .",
            "`` They 're the only group providing this kind of information for people who need it , '' said Dr. Ronald Numbers , a professor of medical history and ethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and an expert on the creationist movement .",
            "Since the center was founded in 1981 , to provide a grass-roots response to creationist challenges , it has been active in all 50 states , Scott said .",
            "Most fights over creationism vs. evolution happen at the local level , in small towns in rural states where populations are fairly homogeneous .",
            "`` You do n't see it in large cities where people come from diverse backgrounds , '' she said .",
            "Dr. Ken Miller , a professor of biology at Brown University in Providence , R.I. , likened the center to `` a national fire department . ''",
            "`` Whenever the scientific integrity of biology teaching is under fire or compromised , '' he said , `` the center goes there to provide support and lend resources to people who are actually fighting the fire . ''",
            "Sometimes a creationist challenge can be `` nipped in the bud '' with just a few well-chosen maneuvers , Scott said .",
            "For example , last year the school board in Post Falls , Idaho , at the behest of creationists in the community , wrote a policy statement that would have allowed creation scientists considerable latitude in making their views known in public schools .",
            "The Center for Science Education , contacted by a member of the community , reviewed the statement and discovered that the school district was opening itself to a violation of the laws of church and state .",
            "The suggestions made by the center kept the school district from running afoul of those laws , and the school curriculum did not change .",
            "In other situations , creationists prevail .",
            "A year ago a committee of educators in Kansas began a routine update of the state 's science standards and called on the center for help on what they knew would be a delicate task .",
            "The statewide committee of 27 science teachers , which submitted the new standards to the Kansas Board of Education , was stunned two weeks ago when the Board decided to drop evolution from the required state curriculum .",
            "The battle to keep evolution in the classroom is a David vs. Goliath struggle .",
            "The Center for Science Education has an annual budget of $ 250,000 , collected from members , compared with the $ 3 million of the Institute of Creation Research in Santee , Calif. , one of several fundamentalist groups trying to discredit the teaching of evolution .",
            "But Scott has a powerful slingshot in the form of clergy members who believe in evolution and scientists who believe in God .",
            "When a local resident steps up before the microphone at a public hearing , says he a faithful Christian and also believes in evolution , people are mightily impressed .",
            "According to several polls , including one reported recently in Scientific American , about 40 percent of scientists believe in God .",
            "In local school board battles , members of the center will find such scientists in the community to testify .",
            "Miller , for example , is both a scientist and Roman Catholic who has testified before numerous school boards on behalf of evolution .",
            "`` The fact that I 'm a practicing Christian takes away their unspoken fear that everyone in science is either an atheist or agnostic , '' he said .",
            "`` I tell them why I believe evolution does n't threaten the faith of young people . ''",

            "`` They are censors and bookburners , '' he said in a telephone interview .",

            "But , he acknowledged , `` They 're effective . ''",
            "The face-offs have changed over the years as creationists have adjusted their tactics .",
            "Early in this century , Scott said , creationists tried to ban the teaching of evolution and lost .",
            "In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws giving equal time to the teaching of creationism alongside evolution .",
            "`` Instead of fighting for equal time , they 've decided to teach the evidence against evolution to balance it out , '' Scott said .",
            "`` If nothing else evolves , creationism does . ''",
            "These days , creationists have turned their attention to gaps in the fossil records and an older argument that life is so intricate and complex it could not have evolved by chance .",
            "Their rubrics are intelligent-design theory , abrupt-appearance theory and irreducible complexity theory .",
            "These new challenges against evolution are being made by conservative Christians at secular universities who are upset over the secularization of American society , Scott said .",
            "They are not trying to ban evolution so much as to undermine it .",
            "The Supreme Court ruled that teachers could teach secular and scientific alternatives to evolution , Scott said .",
            "So the new battles in Kansas and elsewhere pit theory against theory _ intelligent design versus Darwin .",
            "John Richard Schrock , director of biology education at Emporia State University in Kansas and a member of the committee that worked on the state 's science standards , said the center had helped them be aware of how their choice of wording could open doors for intelligent-design theorists and other creationists .",
            "`` We had to remove ambiguity , '' he said .",
            "`` They helped us with our definition of evolution as theory , '' Schrock said .",
            "They also helped change wording in a tolerance statement _ promoting respect for alternative views _ that would not open the door to teaching religious creationism in history classes .",
            "In the end , the School Board ignored the committee 's work and voted in its own viewpoints , Schrock said .",

            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The Supreme Court refused to let a public school district require that the teaching of evolution be accompanied by a disclaimer mentioning `` the biblical version of creation '' and other teachings on life 's origin .",
            "The justices , by a 6-3 vote Monday , let stand rulings that struck down a Louisiana school board 's disclaimer policy as a violation of the constitutionally required separation of government and religion .",
            "Monday 's action was not a precedent-setting decision but only a denial of review .",
            "Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas voted to hear arguments in the case .",
            "The Tangipahoa Parish school board in 1994 voted to require teachers to tell students about to study the theory of evolution that is `` presented to inform students of the scientific concept and not intended to influence or dissuade the biblical version of creation or any other concept . ''",
            "The disclaimer drafted by the school board also said : `` It is the basic right and privilege of each student to form his-her own opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very important matter .",
            "... Students are urged to exercise critical thinking and gather all information possible and closely examine each alternative toward forming an opinion . ''",
            "Three parents of students sued in federal court to challenge the policy , and a federal judge blocked its enforcement .",
            "The judge said the disclaimer was unconstitutional because it had a religious purpose .",
            "A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S .",
            "Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the disclaimer had to be struck down but cited a different reason -- it had the effect of promoting religion .",
            "The panel did not rule out the possibility that a school board could require some type of disclaimer stating that evolution was not the only accepted explanation of the origin of life .",
            "But it said the Tangipahoa Parish disclaimer `` under the facts and circumstances of this case ... is not sufficiently neutral '' to be constitutionally permissible .",
            "In the appeal acted on Monday , lawyers for the school board argued that `` the mere mention of the biblical version of creation by way of illustration does not present a significant risk of perceived endorsement of Bible-based religion . ''",
            "The appeal said reasonable high school or elementary students would not interpret the disclaimer as a pro-religion message .",
            "''The central message of the disclaimer resolution is that there are no outsiders or insiders , no one who is favored or disfavored , on the issue of life 's origin but persons of all viewpoints are full members in the school community . ''",
            "Lawyers for those who challenged the disclaimer disagreed .",
            "''By disclaiming only evolution -- the one element of the school curriculum that generates religious controversy -- the school board has violated both the constitutional mandate of neutrality toward religion and its obligation to provide its students with secular educations free from religious indoctrination or partisanship , '' they said .",
            "They noted that the disclaimer was drafted shortly after the school board voted 5-4 to reject a proposal to teach `` creation-science '' in the district 's schools .",
            "Creation-science teaches that Earth and most life forms came into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago .",
            "Critics have attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of the Book of Genesis .",
            "Evolution , first propounded by Charles Darwin , states that Earth is billions of years old , and that life forms developed gradually several million years ago .",
            "The Supreme Court in 1987 barred states from requiring the teaching of creationism in public schools where evolution is taught , calling such a Louisiana law a thinly veiled attempt to promote religion .",
            "The teaching of evolution has been controversial since the famous 1925 `` monkey law '' trial in which teacher John Scopes was convicted and fined $ 100 for teaching evolution when Tennessee law made it a crime to teach anything but the Biblical version of creation .",
            "Scopes ' conviction later was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court on a procedural matter , and never reached the nation 's highest court .",

            "Writing for the court 's three dissenters Monday , Scalia criticized the court for standing by while an appeals court `` bars a school district from even suggesting to students that other theories besides evolution -- including but not limited to , the biblical theory of creation -- are worthy of their consideration .

            "Influenced by a handful of scientists whose literal faith in the Bible has helped persuade them that the universe is only a few thousand years old , the board deleted from its standards a description of the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins , the central organizing principle of modern astronomy and cosmology .",
            "The Big Bang theory , based on decades of astronomical observations and physics research , suggests that the universe originated in a colossal explosion of matter and radiation some 15 billion years ago .",

            "They have responded with a mixture of disdain , disbelief and consternation , and the reactions have not been limited to physicists and cosmologists in Kansas .",
            "`` It 's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of the universe in terms of modern science , '' said Jerome Friedman , a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990 for collaborating in the discovery of the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the American Physical Society .",

            "But advocates of the creationist view say alarm over their theories is overblown .",
            "Steve Abrams , a member of the Kansas board and veterinarian in Arkansas City who was among the leaders of the push to make the changes , said there are legitimate scientific doubts about whether the universe is more than several thousand years old .",
            "`` There is sufficient data to lend credibility to the idea that we do not have all the answers for teaching the origin of our universe , '' he said .",
            "That sentiment was echoed by John W. Bacon , a board member from Olathe who also voted with a narrow 6-4 majority for the changes .",
            "`` I ca n't understand what they 're squealing about , '' Bacon said of scientists who oppose the board 's action .",
            "Millions or billions of years ago , Bacon said , `` I was n't here , and neither were they .",
            "Based on that , whatever explanation they may arrive at is a theory and it should be taught that way . ''",
            "Those objections closely mirror criticisms leveled at evolution by its opponents .",
            "Alabama biology textbooks , for example , must carry a warning that reads in part : `` No one was present when life first appeared on earth .",
            "Therefore , any statement about life 's origins should be considered as theory , not fact . ''",
            "The Kansas challenge to the teaching of the Big Bang is not the first public objection to the theory on religious or political grounds .",
            "Three years ago , the school superintendent of a conservative county in western Kentucky ordered two pages that explained the Big Bang in grade-school textbooks to be glued together .",
            "The superintendent said that the Big Bang should not have been explained without including the Biblical version of creation as well .",
            "The change in the Kansas standards does not preclude the teaching of mainstream biology , physics or cosmology , allowing teachers to present alternative viewpoints if they choose to do so .",
            "But because the standards are used as the basis for state tests , the changes will probably have a practical effect on what is taught , said Dr. Bill Wagnon , a professor of history at Washburn University in Topeka and a board member who voted in the minority .",
            "Students ' scores on those tests help determine whether a school receives accreditation from the state .",
            "`` The curriculum standards describe that process of what needs to be covered , '' Wagnon said .",
            "So radical were the Kansas board 's recommendations that it has been unable to publish its own standards , or even to display them on its Web site .",
            "That is because the standards include long extracts from a book on education standards that was published by the National Research Council .",
            "Because of its disapproval of the board 's revised standards , the council has refused permission for them to be reprinted .",
            "Beyond the expunging of evolution , the board also took out references to the hundreds of millions of years of Earth 's geologic ages and modified sections on using the slow decay of radioactive elements to measure the ages of fossils and other rocks .",
            "Among the most striking changes , however , was the removal of passages in the original standards dealing with the Big Bang .",
            "Cosmologists see ample evidence for that explosion in the present expansion of the universe , in a diffuse afterglow in space called the cosmic background radiation , and in the precise abundances of light elements like hydrogen and helium that were left over from the cataclysm .",

            "To date , the results of those calculations match the increasingly precise observations of such structures in the heavens .",
            "Of course , for all its success in accounting for observations , the Big Bang is indeed just a theory , although it is one with few scientific dissenters .",
            "The biggest problem for the Young Earth Creationists is explaining the time that has apparently passed since the light we see from distant galaxies was emitted .",

            "The vote effectively made New Mexico the first state in recent years to take a firm stand against the teaching of creationism , which generally recognizes the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed .",
            "Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago , while evolutionists say scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 billion years ago with simple organisms , from which humans and all other forms of life evolved .",

            "In the brief debate among board members that preceded the vote , Berman refuted that position , insisting that creationism _ or `` intelligent design , '' as some evolution opponents call it _ is not a comparable theory for teaching in public schools .",
            "`` If the assumption is there are two sides , I question the assumption , '' Berman told Witt .",
