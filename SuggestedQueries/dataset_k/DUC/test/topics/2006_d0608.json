            "OTTAWA , October 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall .",
            "The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models , make airbags to deploy with less force , and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now .",
            "`` We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks , '' Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers .",
            "`` If the cooperation is n't there , we would have to regulate , '' Anderson warned .",
            "Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers .",
            "They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada .",
            "However , airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians , according to today 's Financial Post newspaper .",
            "Now , airbags only meet specifications set by the United States , where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts , because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts .",
            "In Canada , 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts .",
            "But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States , which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly .",
            "In one case , a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him , the paper said ."

            "The new system , unveiled at the Detroit auto show Wednesday , includes an airbag-like curtain on each side of the vehicle and is a response to the federal government 's revelation that almost half the people who die in light trucks and SUVs die in rollover accidents .",

            "While some auto makers , including Mercedes , Volvo and BMW have air bag curtains that inflate across the car windows and could potentially help during a rollover , experts believe Ford 's is the first that is designed specifically for rollover protection .",
            "More than 9,400 people died in rollover crashes in 1997 , according to the latest year statistics available .",
            "Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in light trucks and SUVs result from rollovers , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , while 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers .",

            "The advisory noted that children under 12 should always sit in the rear seat and use age-appropriate restraints , but manufacturers and insurance industry officials said the warning failed to point out the benefits of side air bags used in conjunction with seat belts and child seats .",
            "Indeed , in all the crash tests cited by the agency the dummies representing children were not wearing seat belts or sitting in a child safety seat .",

            "Detectives came upon it by happenstance while making an arrest at the Royal Garden Apartments at 14625 Rayen St. About 24 people were evacuated because the air bags contain an explosive charge that can launch its 25-pound metal casing some 80 feet , police said .",
            "Details about the arrest were not immediately available , but police said they believe the air bag had been stolen , and that they were trying to track down the owner .",

That equates to a $ 50 million loss to the insurance industry , assuming the average replacement cost for an air bag is $ 1,000 , he said .",

            "Since then the modules have become more sophisticated and are capable of gathering more data .",
            "GM has installed its latest module in hundreds of thousands of GM cars from the 1999 model year .",

            "In his prepared text , Hall warned : `` We need look no further than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not doing so . ''",
            "Air bags inflating in low-speed crashes have been blamed for killing 131 people , including 73 children .",
            "On Wednesday , Hall sent the speech to top auto executives along with a letter urging them `` to discuss with your peers the need to reverse the trend of motor vehicle crashes being the leading cause of death among young Americans . ''",
            "Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children between ages 5 and 15 .",
            "This decade , more than 60,000 children , infants to teen-agers , have died in traffic crashes .",
            "When children are in the car , they ride in the back seat about 70 percent of the time , according to the agency 's analysis of federal crash data from 1996 and 1997 .",
            "Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries .",
            "The back seat is now empty in those crash tests .",
            "The Safety Board also has recommended automakers : -- Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars and light trucks , including the rear center seat , where they are often missing .",
            "-- Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they can be lowered in height to properly fit across children 's chests rather than rise up at their necks .",
            "Most autos have adjustable shoulder belts only in the front seats .",
            "-- Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats .",

            "Since 1990 , many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner 's black box , or flight data recorder , which automatically records the vehicle 's speed , throttle setting , braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment .",
            "Until now , however , it was difficult to extract that information from the car 's air bag control module .",

            "The $ 2,500 device _ called a Crash Data Retrieval System _ is being marketed to police departments , insurance companies and auto-rental agencies to help them reconstruct crashes to determine fault .",
            "`` The system lets investigators collect objective , accurate data on crashes to enhance reconstruction ( of accidents ) , '' said Jim Zaleski , president of Santa Barbara-based Vetronix Corp. , which markets the device .",
            "`` This opens the door to a new generation of understanding and modeling automobile accidents , '' he said .",
            "Some of the vehicles that have the capability to provide such data also can tell investigators whether the car 's occupants were wearing seatbelts and whether the passenger-side air bag had been deactivated .",

            "`` This technology is n't measuring anything new , but it is measuring it more accurately than in the past , '' he said .",
            "`` On the engineering side , it will help the design engineer find out whether safety systems work as well in real crashes as they do in laboratory crash tests .",

            "But Haseltine and others , including officials at General Motors , say there are privacy issues that have kept the technology from advancing as rapidly as it could have .",

            "But Vetronix promotes the system as something investigators can use almost immediately , at a crash site , to download the information , and there are concerns that such a situation sometimes might preclude getting a vehicle owner 's permission .",
            "The impetus to record this information to aid crash investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board , which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard collision-sensing and -recording devices .",
            "The NTSB has long required that such equipment be installed on most modes of public transportation , including airliners , buses and trains .",
