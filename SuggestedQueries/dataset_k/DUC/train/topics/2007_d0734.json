            "As a healing technique , acupuncture boasts an impressive track record .",
            "By inserting tiny needles into various areas of the body , practitioners of this Chinese therapy have shown the value of acupuncture in relieving pain , easing nausea and lowering blood pressure .",
            "Now , acupuncturists say that their services can also erase signs of aging .",
            "Cosmetic acupuncture works in a variety of ways , says licensed acupuncturist and traditional-Chinese-medicine practitioner Phyllis Olson .",
            "Inserting a needle into the skin causes oxygenated , nutrient-rich blood to rush to that spot .",

            "Acupuncturists believe that the body 's energy , or chi , takes certain pathways .",
            "By using needles to access points on those pathways , an acupuncturist can move the energy where it 's needed to speed healing or eliminate damage .",
            "While there 's no scientific evidence to back up these claims , cosmetic acupuncture may have some benefits , says Dr. Barney Kenet , a dermatologic surgeon at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center .",

            "Otherwise , cosmetic acupuncture is relatively harmless .",
            "If you 're interested in trying it , keep expectations in check and enjoy the experience .",
            "Aside from the momentary stings , acupuncture is really quite relaxing , Olson says .",
            "The treatment _ depending on the amount of wrinkles _ consists of about 20 to 25 superfine needles being inserted into the face , ear or hand .",
            "The price runs from $ 60 to $ 100 per session .",
            "What sort of results can you expect ?",
            "Improvement after the first treatment can last about a week .",

            "`` They treated my cancer , but they also helped me through my fears , so I went into surgery incredibly calm and confident . ''",
            "In addition , Lasky got help in dealing with pain and recuperation _ and the news that she 'd need a second operation to remove a spot from her lung .",
            "Thankfully , the tissue in her lung proved noncancerous , and she left the hospital in half the expected time and with much less pain medication .",
            "This integrative approach to treating an illness certainly is n't new .",
            "But the fact that Lasky was able to get multifaceted treatment at a single facility is indicative of a growing trend in health care : the integrative medicine facility .",
            "Across the country , an ever-increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care organizations are setting up complementary-care centers .",
            "As yet , no one is tracking these centers as a group , but last year , the American Hospital Association found that roughly 9 percent of U.S. hospitals offer complementary services ; some estimates say that between 25 and 50 complementary centers affiliated with hospitals are presently open or will be opening in the near future .",
            "Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors and alternative practitioners who work together to determine each patient 's course of treatment .",
            "Others offer individual therapies such as therapeutic touch or guided imagery to patients who ask for it .",
            "`` If you look at what was happening even a few years ago , the extent to which complementary services have become part of the health-care system is astonishing , '' said John Weeks , editor and publisher of The Integrator , a newsletter covering the business of alternative medicine .",
            "`` We 're really in the first phase of a process that will evolve over the next 10 or 20 years . ''",
            "`` As we see more and more consumers making health-care decisions for themselves , this trend is really going to take off , '' said Dr. Samuel Benjamin , director of the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the State University of New York , Stony Brook .",

            "Many complementary-care clinics are also moving beyond patient care to address one of the biggest concerns in integrative medicine : the information shortfall .",
            "Patients often use alternative therapies in a smorgasbord-like way , without a complete understanding of the advantages or risks involved .",
            "`` Part of what got me into the development of our center is that I knew my patients were already using alternative therapies , '' said Dr. Mimi Guarneri , an interventional cardiologist and the medical director of the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla , Calif. `` They were out there buying every vitamin and herb they could find , and I was concerned that they might not know enough about what they were taking . ''",
            "With this in mind , hospitals like Scripps have set up classes to inform patients about various alternative therapies .",
            "Since traditionally schooled physicians are often unduly skeptical about complementary approaches , many clinics have also made research and analysis part of their standard operations .",
            "`` If we do n't evaluate the evidence with an objective eye , there 's no way that complementary therapies can ever be brought into the medical mainstream in a way that makes sense , '' said Guarneri .",
            "`` As a physician , you ca n't stand up and present anecdotes without being thrown out of the room . ''",
            "Virtually all of the centers track patient outcomes and share that information with other hospitals nationwide .",
            "Many centers are conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual therapies _ the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , for one , is researching complementary treatments for asthma , while George Washington University 's Center for Integrative Medicine in Washington , D.C. , is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating carpal tunnel syndrome .",
            "Of course , what matters to patients is n't hard-core data but real-life outcomes .",

            "Weil , who is on the cutting edge of what is new in alternative medicine , sparred on most points with Relman , editor and chief emeritus at the New England School of Medicine , who is squarely from the mainstream medical community .",
            "The debate came on the wings of a scathing article Relman wrote in the `` New '' `` Republic , '' in which he referred to Weil 's methods as preposterous .",
            "At the debate , he said Weil 's therapies are `` based on wildly implausible theories . ''",
            "The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment that the mainstream medical community is no longer ignoring alternative medicine .",
