            "Manuel Indiano , 29 , was shot 10 times in the chest and abdomen outside his candy store in Zumarraga , a Basque town , about 250 miles north of Madrid , police said .",
            "Indiano , who authorities said refused police protection normally offered politicians in the Basque region , died in the town 's hospital an hour after the attack .",

            "The conservative party fiercely opposes Basque separatism and other moves to change Spain 's political makeup .",
            "No one took responsibility for the shooting , but Interior Ministry officials immediately blamed ETA , which began its campaign for independence of the three-province northern region in 1968 .",
            "The killing brought to 12 the number of slayings -- five this month -- attributed to ETA since it ended a 14-month truce last December .",
            "The group , whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom , has been blamed for killing nearly 800 people .",

            "It was the height of the Spanish Civil War , and Basque country was in flames .",

            "Dublin was already his second home .",
            "Inspired by the stubborn Irish fight for independence , the elder Gallastegi had written a history of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule , and in 1932 founded a trading firm in Bilbao to import eggs , potatoes and pork from the young Irish Free State .",
            "In their Dublin exile , the Gallastegi children were raised on an uncompromising mixture of Basque separatism and Irish republicanism .",
            "Eventually , that education led Iker himself to return to Basque country as a young nationalist organizer in 1952 under an assumed name , and to flee once again just ahead of Franco 's police .",

            "The relationships between the underground ETA and Herri Batasuna _ and major elements in their strategy , training and recruitment methods _ are mirror images of the relationship between Sinn Fein , the militant but legal Irish political party , and its own armed wing , the Irish Republican Army .",

            "So boisterously , in fact , that republican leaders were obliged to restrain the young Basques , who in one instance tried to lead a headlong charge against police lines .",

            "Like its significant other in Ireland , Herri Batasuna ran candidates in regional elections for three decades , only to decline the seats it won in protest against `` foreign rule . ''",

            "`` Before Lizarra , the football field had always been the Spanish state , '' says Eusebio Lasa , a member of Herri Batasuna 's national council .",

            "`` We agree now ( with Herri Batasuna ) that there was no great difference between those two parties when it came to Basques .",
            "Neither was interested in talking about a different future here , about any real self-determination , '' he says .",
            "PNV leaders point out that few , if any , regional autonomy measures promised as long ago as the 1970s were implemented when the Socialists or conservatives were part of the regional governing coalition .",
            "According to the Spanish constitution , even a referendum on self-determination in Basque country remains strictly against the law .",
            "This is where the Irish experience no longer fits the Basque reality .",
            "The Good Friday Agreement was reached under the auspices of a British government desperate to extricate itself from the Northern Ireland quagmire , and more than happy to have the end game played in Belfast rather than London .",
            "The problems since in implementing self-rule in Northern Ireland have not come from 10 Downing Street , but from die-hard factions within the unionist and republican camps .",
            "By contrast , there is no war in Basque country between communities , no exchange of atrocities between Bilbao versions of the Catholic and Protestant gunmen who haunt Belfast .",
            "`` The enemy is n't the Spanish lad next door , '' says Gallastegi .",
            "`` It 's the national state , '' in the form of a central government that responded to the historic cease-fire by arresting the very people with whom it must negotiate .",
            "`` When I arrived in power , I said , ` I will never talk with ETA . '",
            "If there is no peace , ETA and ETA alone will be responsible , '' says Aznar , pointing out that ETA has been responsible for more than 800 killings in the past three decades , mostly of government officials .",

            "Moleres ' offer to help arrange negotiations was rejected by the Aznar government , which opposes any international mediation in the crisis .",
            "The crackdown began just as Basque nationalists were laying the groundwork for the cease-fire in October 1997 , when the entire 23-member leadership council of Herri Batasuna was sentenced to lengthy jail terms for distributing a video that presented ETA 's terms for peace .",
            "According to many observers , the imprisoned council members were the most negotiation-minded of the organization 's factions to hold sway in years .",
            "They join more than 500 Basque political activists now in prison .",
            "Since then , ETA militants have been found dead , under suspicious circumstances that recall the work of secret assassination squads in the 1980s that were linked to the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez .",
