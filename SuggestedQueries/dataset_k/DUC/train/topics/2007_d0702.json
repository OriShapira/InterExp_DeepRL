            "That investment is not enough to bring the arts into every classroom , but in this flush economy , private foundations are joining cultural institutions in spending money on arts education partnerships .",

            "Most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their expertise , ranging from a few dollars per student for a single lecture or performance to upward of $ 50,000 for ongoing classroom visits and teacher training by several teaching artists .",
            "`` It takes so much extra work to start something like this , '' said Verano LaRue , the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and Dance Studios , which Public School 156 is paying about $ 40,000 this year to incorporate dance into the school 's curriculum .",

            "But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the arts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students that they are as important an academic subject as math , reading and science .",

            "In effect , he said , he 's doubling the Percent for Arts Program , because he 's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside but owned by the city .",

            "In the meantime , the task force recommended that the city set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts commission , and that the commission become a city department : the city 's centralized art source .",
            "Schell plans to study and refine the $ 200 million idea but nixed the other two suggestions , saying the general fund 's support for the arts is already more than 1 percent , closer to 1.5 percent , but it 's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized in the arts commission .",
            "He 's against centralization , as it turns out , preferring to continue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission but through community parks , libraries , community centers and the Neighborhood Matching Funds .",
