            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The government proposed Tuesday to reduce federal protection of endangered gray wolves , saying they had successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more could die as a result of the change .",
            "The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the wolves -- all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest -- as threatened rather than endangered .",
            "That means authorities would have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into account concerns from private landowners .",
            "The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced to parts of New Mexico and Arizona -- only 22 wolves -- would remain endangered because they continue to be under the threat of extinction , officials said .",
            "Jamie Rappaport Clark , director of the U.S .",
            "Fish and Wildlife Service , said the recovery of the gray wolf -- also known as the timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was `` an endangered species success story . ''",
            "But she said the increase in the number of wolves will allow her agency to `` structure wolf recovery to meet the needs of the species and those of the people . ''",
            "While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection , the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as `` threatened '' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found , federal wolf experts said .",
            "Those include vast areas of the West and even parts of New England , they said .",
            "For example , the less restrictive designation might convince landowners in the Northeast -- where currently there are no wolves known to exist , despite ideal habitat for the animal -- to accept future wolf recovery plans from Maine to upstate New York , officials said .",
            "But as threatened -- a less protective designation under the federal Endangered Species Act -- some wolves also may be captured or killed if they threaten livestock or fall under another less restrictive provision of a formal wolf management plan .",
            "The gray wolf is currently classified as endangered throughout the country except in Alaska and in Minnesota -- where it has a `` threatened '' classification .",
            "But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995 .",
            "Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s , today there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan .",
            "The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming , Idaho and Montana .",
            "''We made the right choice to ... bring these animals back from the brink of extinction , '' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt , in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant reclassification .",
            "The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf 's range .",
            "''It 's a mixture of good news and bad , '' said Bob Ferris of Defenders of Wildlife .",
            "He said he was n't opposed to the reclassification , but was concerned that the government `` is not considering any further recovery areas '' and that some wolves could lose federal protection entirely .",
            "The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal `` reflects the success of wolf recovery programs , '' it `` falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery '' of wolves in the West .",
            "Under the proposal , the U.S .",
            "Fish and Wildlife Service would establish four distinct population segments , based on the primary ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate .",
            "The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely .",

            "Many farmers and ranchers in the affected regions had hoped that a 2-year-old federal district court 's decision to dismantle the program would be upheld .",
            "Babbitt regards the Jan. 13 appeals court decision overruling the lower federal court as `` a welcome vindication of our efforts to preserve this magnificent species . ''",
            "In December 1997 , Judge William Downes of the U.S. District Court of the District of Wyoming ruled that the U.S .",
            "Fish & AMP ; Wildlife Service , as an agency of the Department of the Interior , had violated the Endangered Species Act and the intent of Congress with its wolf recovery program .",
            "Under the program , Canadian gray wolves were relocated in Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an `` experimental and nonessential '' wolf population , which means they lost much of the protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species Act .",
            "Any stray wolves already in the regions or who migrate there also lose the protective shield that the law provides .",
            "Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973 to `` provide for the conservation , protection , restoration , and propagation of species of fish , wildlife , and plants facing extinction . ''",
            "Under the act , the Department of the Interior is not allowed to introduce an experimental population of an endangered species in the same geographical area where there is already an existing population of the same species .",
            "Part of the lower federal court 's decision pivoted on the term `` population . ''",
            "Wolves do wander through Yellowstone and central Idaho .",
            "However , do stragglers or wolves traveling with mates constitute a population ?",
            "In 1994 , the Fish & AMP ; Wildlife Service issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement on the wolf reintroduction plan .",
            "It stated : `` Scientific evidence does not indicate that any population of wolves persisted or currently exists in the Yellowstone or central Idaho areas . ''",

            "The introduction of an experimental population can not operate as a de facto ` delisting ' of naturally occurring wolves . ''",
            "Downes concludes that the Department of the Interior 's `` blanket treatment of all wolves found within the designated experimental population areas as experimental animals is contrary to law . ''",
            "The judge 's decision set aside the wolf recovery plan and ordered all the introduced wolves and their offspring removed from Yellowstone and central Idaho .",
            "Recognizing the importance and the ramifications of his ruling , Downes imposed a stay on his judgment pending an appeal .",
            "The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals had little patience with Downes ' legal reasoning .",
            "It pounced on the soft spot in his analysis like Dracula on a jugular vein .",
            "The appellate court begins with basic separation of powers tradition : If Congress has clearly spoken to a national public policy issue , then unless Congress has taken an unconstitutional position , a federal court bows to its authority .",
            "If Congress is silent on the issue and has delegated authority over the matter to a lawful federal agency , then the court defers to the agency 's interpretation _ unless that is unconstitutional .",
            "In the Endangered Species Act , Congress did not define the term `` population '' ; therefore , the appellate court reasoned , `` Congress deliberately left the resolution of this type of management/conservation issue to the Department ( of the Interior ) . ''",
            "And federal wildlife biologists define a wolf `` population '' as at least two wild breeding pairs that raise at least two young in an area for the previous two years .",
            "There is no evidence that a naturally occurring wolf population existed in Yellowstone or central Idaho prior to the introduction of the gray wolves .",
            "Therefore , concluded the appellate court , on that question , the Department of the Interior did not violate the Endangered Species Act .",
            "The appellate court wasted little time on the issue of `` de facto ` delisting '' ' of wolves already in the area , which Downes found in violation of the Endangered Species Act .",
            "The appellate court wrote : `` We believe this holding unnecessarily limits the administrative discretion and flexibility Congress intentionally incorporated into section 10 ( j ) ( of the ESA ) , ignores biological reality , and misconstrues the larger purposes of the Endangered Species Act . ''",
            "The court explains further : `` It is not difficult to imagine that sound population management practices tailored to the biological circumstances of a particular species could facilitate a more effective and efficient species-wide recovery , even if the process renders some individual animals more vulnerable .",

            "At the end of November , after bullets had felled 5 animals , biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona 's Apache National Forest , bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf , which became extinct in the wild in 1977 .",
            "By the end of the year biologists , who have bred from just 5 animals a total of 150 wolves with the ultimate goal of having 100 in the wild and 240 in captivity , had begun reintroducing the wolves into the wild again .",
            "But whether they can achieve their goal , and at what cost to the wolves , remain open questions .",
            "Long practiced as a way to replace stocks for hunting and fishing , captive breeding came to be seen in the 1970s as a panacea for species teetering on the edge of extinction .",
            "Zoos began to promote themselves as latter-day Noah 's Arks , capable of preserving stable , genetically sound populations of rare animals until the world was ready to welcome them back to a reconstructed nature , be it a century or more in the future .",
            "In the 1970s and 80s , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service collected not only Mexican wolves but also red wolves , California condors , and black-footed ferrets from the wild in order to restore their populations through captive breeding , in cooperation with zoos , and then return them to their native habitats .",
            "Similar programs were begun for species in other parts of the world while advances in reproductive technologies inspired plans for preserving frozen embryos and sperm in high-technology gene banks .",
            "In 1994 the World Conservation Union 's captive breeding specialist group suggested that the world 's zoos could breed and maintain as many as 2,000 endangered species of vertebrates .",
            "The recent developments with the Mexican wolf and those three other high-profile rescue programs have underscored the perils and promise of reintroducing captive bred animals .",
            "The program to restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey .",
            "With one free-ranging population of nearly 100 animals in eastern North Carolina , project leaders are seeking suitable habitat for future releases , but blocks of more than 170,000 acres with minimal risk of conflicts with human activities and sufficient prey for wolves are scarce in the Southeastern United States .",
            "On the other hand , biologists estimate that there are as many as 56 condors now riding thermal currents over Southern California and adjacent areas _ a remarkable recovery for the huge carrion eater that became extinct in the wild in 1987 .",
            "And the black-footed ferret , which nearly vanished from the Earth a decade ago , is producing a bumper crop of kits in and out of captivity , primarily in South Dakota , Montana , and a large breeding operation in Wyoming .",
            "But the condor and black-footed ferret remain vulnerable .",
            "Although they have bred well in captivity , none of the released condors has yet reproduced in the wild , and they are particularly sensitive to lead , which litters the landscape and is toxic to them in small doses .",
            "Across the West , a plague is obliterating black-tailed prairie dogs , the black-footed ferrets ' sole food source .",
            "Even without the plague , habitat is being lost at an alarming rate to development and prairie-dog eradication programs .",
            "Peter Gober , a United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Pierre , S.D. , said , `` I do n't expect the ferret ever to be recovered to the point where it can be downlisted from endangered to threatened . ''",
            "Indeed , despite the sometimes spectacular achievements of these programs , captive breeding has come under fire in recent years as a costly , often futile exercise that does little to address the underlying problems , especially habitat loss and fragmentation , not to mention poaching and pollutants , that are pushing species toward extinction .",
            "Collectively , the condor , wolf and ferret programs have already cost more than $ 50 million .",
            "A five-year , $ 2.3 million effort initiated by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association to establish a captive breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros collapsed in 1993 without producing a single birth or protecting any wild rhinos .",

            "`` You 're not going to have more habitat in 50 or 100 years than you do now . ''",
            "Critics also maintain that the reintroduction process is wasteful of individual animals , many of which die because they do not know how to live outside a cage .",
            "Other problems include a lack of space and resources for preserving populations of animals indefinitely , the development of behavioral problems in some species , and inbreeding among captive animals that can lead to genetic abnormalities and other health problems .",

            "The draft study , performed by 119 independent scientists with National Science Foundation funding , highlights scientific weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans , which the administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing species protected by the Act .",
            "The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal government .",
            "They allow the landowners to develop , mine , log _ or otherwise use _ their property .",
            "In return , the landowners agree to make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered plants or animals .",
            "The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land , and they 're spreading rapidly .",
            "The areas covered by the habitat conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded woodpecker 's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina .",
            "Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as `` innovative '' and `` helpful . ''",
            "He said it is spurring his agency to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning .",
            "Overall , the study concludes that the plans often lack scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk species .",
            "Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or animals would be disturbed , show how this would affect the species ' survival , or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the species actually fare , the study says .",
            "The problems stem , in part , from a lack of available scientific data , according to the study , which also says that the estimates of the plans ' impact on senstivie species are , at times , `` very close to a guess . ''",
            "The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of private land , the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat , to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost .",
            "And large landowners , especially timber companies in the Northwest , have come to enthusiastically embrace the plans .",

            "That land includes one quarter of non-federal commercial timberland in the region .",
            "In recent years , the plans have drawn mounting criticism from environmental groups and some conservation biologists .",
            "A draft of the new study , obtained by the Post-Intelligencer , supported some of those complaints .",
            "It found : _ No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about two-thirds of the species covered .",
            "_ Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the species ' survival was `` especially common . ''",
            "_ Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is practicable , as the Endangered Species Act requires .",
            "_ Less than 10 percent of the plans `` had clear monitoring programs that were sufficient for evaluating success . ''",
            "_ About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat .",
            "_ The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100 years , with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked , without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide adequate species protection .",

            "Federal officials noted that the plans can not be delayed for perfect data and are negotiated compromises , not pure science .",
            "The study follows mounting criticism from other quarters .",

            "In part because of those questions , no recovery effort is likely in the Northeast for many years , officials said .",
            "In the rest of the contiguous states , the proposal says , wolves are never likely to be seen again , and thus in these areas _ 30 states in all _ the animals will be dropped from the list entirely , leaving any future decisions about restoration up to state officials .",

            "`` To ignore that kind of potential is foolhardy , '' Arapkiles said .",
            "But federal wildlife officials are standing by their conclusions , saying that the federal list of endangered species is the ecological equivalent of a hospital 's intensive care unit , and that wolves are clearly ready for the recovery room .",

            "`` At best , those wolves have a tiny toehold on the landscape , '' Refsnider said , referring to areas along the Mexican border that could support the Mexican subspecies .",
            "Right now , he said , fewer than two dozen wolves roam there .",
            "Any significant new federal programs to expand the range of wolves , he said , would come at the expense of other species that might be just as important ecologically , but that do not have the mystique and high profile of a legendary predator .",
            "`` There was no intention that the act should be providing long-term care for these species , '' Refsnider said .",
            "`` The intent is to pull them back from the brink for the foreseeable future and turn them over to normal management agencies .",
