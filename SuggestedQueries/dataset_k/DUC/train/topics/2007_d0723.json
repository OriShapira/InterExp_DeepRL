            "STOCKTON , Calif. _ Sen. Barbara Boxer is fighting to re-establish what some analysts say could be her greatest asset in her race for re-election : incumbency .",
            "In a campaign swing through California 's fertile Central Valley , the Democratic incumbent reminded voters of her service in Washington over the past six years .",
            "`` We did a lot together , '' Boxer told 50 supporters Thursday at an event in Stockton highlighting her support for the 1994 crime bill , which provided funding for 173 new police officers in that city .",
            "`` I want to keep us working together . ''",
            "The trip comes as a new poll by the Los Angeles Times shows Boxer pulling slightly ahead of her Republican opponent , state Treasurer Matt Fong , by 5 percentage points , 49 percent to 44 percent , among those likely to vote in the Nov. 3 election .",
            "That is seen as less a sign of a newfound popularity for Boxer than proof the negative commercials she has begun running against Fong on issues like abortion and the environment are cutting into his support .",
            "Some political observers have criticized Boxer for doing little in her race against Fong to remind voters that she is a sitting senator at a time when the economy is solid , crime is down and voters are generally content .",
            "`` She needs to focus on what she has delivered for California , '' said Barbara O'Connor , communications professor at California State University in Sacramento .",
            "`` She needs to highlight what she 's been able to bring home . ''",
            "With just days before the election , both Boxer and Fong are crisscrossing the state .",
            "Each is still furiously raising money in order to plaster voters with expensive , last-minute television commercials .",
            "For Fong , the campaign has become nearly all fund-raising , with rarely more than one public event a day .",
            "He explains that he has held public events throughout the campaign , but must now focus on securing cash .",
            "`` As a challenger , I need to raise the dollars to compete , '' Fong said after a $ 125,000 fund-raiser in San Francisco Wednesday night .",
            "Citing the new barrage of negative ads against him , `` I have to answer those charges , and that 's what we 're doing . ''",
            "Fong , who adeptly used the President Clinton 's affair with a former White House intern to bash Boxer early in the race , is now seeking to weaken her by linking her to labor unions and trial lawyers , who have been among the largest contributors to her campaign .",
            "At a luncheon Wednesday at the San Jose Rotary Club , he accused Boxer of siding with the trial lawyers who supported Proposition 211 , a failed measure to allow shareholder lawsuits against companies if their stock price plummeted .",
            "Many Silicon Valley companies fought the initiative .",
            "He also said Boxer sided with labor union bosses in opposing broader trade-negotiating powers for the president .",
            "Fong is counting on supporters like Helen Buckholtz , a Portola Valley Republican , who said she supports Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , but wo n't vote for Boxer because she 's `` too negative , too partisan . ''",
            "Boxer 's Central Valley campaign tour Thursday took her through some areas where she has had little support in the past .",
            "In her 1992 election , her opponent , conservative television commentator Bruce Herschensohn , out-polled her in several key Central Valley counties : Fresno ( 55 percent to 37 percent ) , Merced ( 49 percent to 39 percent ) and Madera ( 60 percent to 32 percent ) .",
            "A Public Policy Institute of California poll last week showed Boxer trailing Fong in the more conservative Central Valley , but had her in a dead heat with her Republican challenger statewide ."

            "He narrowly lost a bid for the U.S. Senate primary in 1992 to ultra-conservative Bruce Herschenson , who in turn was defeated in the general election by liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer _ a race many observers believed Campbell would have won had he faced her .",
            "The last poll on the Feinstein-Campbell race was two weeks before California 's March primary , when Feinstein had 54 percent to Campbell 's 36 percent .",

            "Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the School of Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate University said Feinstein probably earned points among Democrats and Republicans alike by coming out early in her criticisms of President Clinton 's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky .",

            "After meeting for 45 minutes with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana , Feinstein described them as `` heartbroken '' and `` sobbing '' and said she would do `` whatever I can '' to protect their rights .",

            "Besides Feinstein , the women met with Sen. Arlen Specter , R-Pa. , and Reps. Maxine Waters , D-Calif. , and George R. Nethercutt Jr. , R-Wash. Feinstein said she told Rodriguez and Quintana that U.S. law and immigration policies are on their side .",

            "WASHINGTON _ For the first time since reading the special prosecutor 's report on President Clinton 's affair with a onetime intern , Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt `` a personal sense of betrayal '' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the president about it .",
            "But Feinstein , D-Calif. , said talk about whether Clinton should resign `` is way premature '' and said the congressional investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed to play out .",
            "In a rare interview in her office , Feinstein was at times at a loss for words when trying to describe the `` sadness and disappointment '' she felt after reading the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr , a task she said took four hours .",
            "She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the 1960s `` is different '' from Clinton 's situation and `` only increases animosity '' from Republicans .",
            "`` This was an intern , '' Feinstein said , referring to Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky .",
            "`` This was something while he was president .",
            "That 's its pertinence .",
            "The fact that it was in the White House , in the Oval Office . ''",
            "Hyde , R-Ill. , has acknowledged the affair occurred .",
            "It took place in the 1960s , before Hyde ran for Congress .",
            "Feinstein said she turned down an offer from one of Clinton 's aides to talk with the president about the Lewinsky affair .",
            "`` I said I did n't want to talk to the president , '' Feinstein said .",
            "`` I was angry . ''",
            "Since then , Feinstein said , she has n't talked to the president but has consulted on other matters with members of his administration .",
            "`` To be candid , it 's still hard to believe , '' said Feinstein , who is the senior senator from California , a state Clinton has assiduously courted throughout his presidency .",
            "`` This is the kind of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me . ''",
            "However , she added , `` I can separate my personal dismay and disappointment from what I have to do as a senator . '",
            "Clinton 's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair , and the sordid details surrounding it , have drawn a growing number of Democrats in Congress to criticize the president 's conduct .",
            "But most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from office because of an extramarital relationship .",
            "Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a videotape of the president 's Aug. 17 testimony before the federal grand jury investigating his conduct .",
            "After the testimony , Clinton went on national television and admitted having an extramarital relationship with Lewinsky .",
            "`` If there 's something that adds light to the situation and is pertinent to the situation , it might be a wise thing to do , '' Feinstein said .",
            "`` But if it 's something to inflame the situation , I do n't think that 's what it should be about . ''",
            "She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses .",
            "The Starr report accused the president of perjury , abuse of power and obstruction of justice in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair .",
            "`` I hope we can have a relatively short process , '' Feinstein said .",
            "`` I hope it does not drag on for a year and a half .",
            "Feinstein recalled how she was sitting only a few feet away from Clinton in the White House in January when he waved his index finger at the television cameras and denied to the nation that he had ever had `` sexual relations '' with Lewinsky .",
            "Feinstein said `` the body language '' and the `` directness of the statement '' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed that for seven months .",
            "`` I believed it and I believed it totally , '' she said .",
            "Later , when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to convince others he was telling the truth , she was even more certain .",
            "But then she was shattered .",
            "`` On August 17 , when I heard the statement , my world came crashing down , '' Feinstein said .",
            "`` I feel a personal sense of betrayal .",
            "I felt a gut-level deep sense of betrayal . ''",
            "At the time , Feinstein told reporters her faith in the president 's credibility was badly `` shattered . ''",
            "Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls from constituents since Friday , when the Starr report was made public , as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages .",
            "`` Some people are in tears , some are irate and some are extraordinarily supportive of the president , '' she said .",
            "`` This has a long , long tail on it .",
            "It 's not just the president .",
            "It 's the future of the American presidency too . ''",
            "If Clinton is to survive the scandal , `` he will need to show he will continue to be a strong president , '' Feinstein said .",
            "`` That 's where the jury 's out . ''"
