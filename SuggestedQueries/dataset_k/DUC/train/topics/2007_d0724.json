            "LOS ANGELES _ Americans are gobbling down more calories than ever , resulting in a 50 percent increase in the nation 's obesity rate , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday .",
            "Young people , the more highly educated and Hispanics are leading the way .",
            "The figures released by the federal agency in Atlanta show that 17.9 percent of Americans are obese .",
            "In 1991 the proportion was 12 percent .",
            "And 45 of the 50 states have rates of obesity of more than 15 percent , compared with just four states in 1991 .",
            "Federal guidelines define obesity as being at least 30 percent above ideal weight .",
            "For example , a 5-foot-9-inch person who weighs more than 220 pounds is considered obese .",
            "CDC officials said the results of the study , based on a large telephone survey of more than 100,000 people , are further evidence that more effort must go into public health campaigns to combat poor eating habits and encourage physical activity .",
            "Obesity is linked to many chronic and life-threatening diseases , including heart disease , diabetes and hypertension .",
            "Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine in Medford , Mass. , reported Monday that 280,000 deaths a year can be attributed to obesity .",
            "The CDC data , to be published in Wednesday 's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association , revealed that obesity was increasing fastest among 18- to 29-year-olds , people with college educations and people of Hispanic descent .",
            "The survey did not find any significant changes in the rates of physical activity , indicating that overeating was the cause of most of the increase in weight gain .",
            "Also in the same issue of the medical journal : _ Researchers at Children 's Hospital in Boston report that young people who ate more fiber were less likely to be obese and have high blood pressure and high levels of bad cholesterol .",
            "Fiber outstripped lower fat intake as being correlated with those positive health results .",
            "_ A researcher from Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York found that injections of the hormone leptin increased weight loss for both obese and lean subjects .",
            "Like other tests of leptin , which is linked to appetite regulation , the studies did not demonstrate a dramatic difference , although users did lose more than those who received injections of a placebo .",
            "At the highest doses , obese patients lost an average of 15.6 pounds after 24 weeks .",
            "They were also on a diet designed to give them 500 fewer calories per day than they needed to maintain their normal weight ."

            "LOS ANGELES , October 11 ( Xinhua ) -- Two studies published this month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the substantial health risks of obesity .",
            "Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients .",
            "Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major , modifiable risk factor for heart disease , the leading cause of death in the United States .",
            "Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity .",
            "According to Policy Analysis Inc. , a health economic research firm , obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion dollars annually .",
            "The studies are based on data relating to a person 's degree of obesity to their risks of five major diseases -- coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes , stroke , high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol .",
            "In these studies , obesity was measured in terms of body mass index ( BMI ) , which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters .",
            "The first study , published in Monday 's issue of Archives of Internal Medicine , reports that persons with high BMIs have higher lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases .",
            "For example , men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese ( BMI of 32kg/m2 ) have more than twice the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure of non-obese men ( BMI of 22.5 kg/m2 ) of the same age , and almost three times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes .",
            "Risks are even greater among those who are severely obese .",
            "Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health , the other study examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese .",
            "The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension , type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia .",
            "The likelihood of developing coronary heart disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000 persons , and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000 ."

            "The national epidemic of obesity is at such a crisis that it demands urgent attention by medical professionals , the government and the public .",
            "That was the message repeated again and again this week by experts at the American Dietetic Association 's annual meeting in Kansas City .",
            "They came armed with statistics and a missionary zeal to enlist dietitians as front-line fighters in the war against obesity .",

            "The average man now weighs 25 pounds more than men of his great-grandfather 's generation .",
            "The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture of abundance and inactivity , said the experts on causes and treatment .",
            "We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk , fast food is available 24 hours a day , children are bombarded with advertisements for junk food , and one-quarter of all the vegetables we eat are french fries .",
            "`` The average American , particularly children , recognizes ` supersize ' as a verb , '' said Yale University psychologist Kelly Brownell , referring to the term for ordering larger portions of french fries at McDonald 's restaurants .",
            "The health effects of obesity have been staggering .",
            "The condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels , according to figures cited at the meeting Wednesday .",
            "The cost of treating obesity-related diseases adds up to $ 52 billion per year , according to estimates cited by the National Institutes of Health .",
            "When indirect costs of obesity , such as lost productivity , are added in , the sum approaches $ 100 billion .",
            "In the past many doctors did not consider obesity a medical problem and left its treatment to fad diet promoters , said Louis Aronne , clinical professor of medicine at Cornell University Medical College .",
            "He was one of the speakers at the Dietetic Association meeting .",
            "New research on the biological basis of obesity and the urgency of the epidemic have changed their perspective , he said .",
            "For example , in June the American Heart Association put obesity alongside smoking , high blood pressure and cholesterol , and sedentary lifestyle on its list of major modifiable risk factors for heart attack and coronary heart disease .",
            "Obesity treatment `` has been on the fringe on the infomercials ; now it 's moving into prime time , '' Aronne said .",
            "Dozens of diet drugs are being developed so that one day doctors will be `` capable of controlling body weight completely , '' he predicted .",
            "Until that time , however , doctors and their patients will have to give up the idea of turning overweight people into sleek hard bodies and settle for more modest and attainable weight loss , experts said .",
            "& LR ; brk : No quick cure & LR ; tx : Obesity is a chronic disease that requires regular medical treatment and a lifelong commitment by patients to control their weight .",
            "People who quickly lose large amounts of weight typically gain it all back in a few years .",
            "`` We all tried to get ( obese patients ) down to skinny little people , and that 's impossible , '' said John Foreyt , a psychologist at Baylor College of Medicine .",
            "`` Keep patient expectations realistic .... None of us is in the business of cosmetics .",
            "We 're in the business of helping patients improve their health . ''",
            "Losing 10 percent of one 's weight is a realistic initial goal , said F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , director of the obesity research center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York .",
            "But even dropping five or 10 pounds can be beneficial .",
            "`` A small and achievable weight loss can have a major impact on health risks , '' said Pi-Sunyer .",
            "Pi-Sunyer was chairman of a federal panel of experts that issued guidelines in June on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity .",
            "According to the panel , people are considered overweight if their body mass indexes , a comparison of weight to height , are 25 or over .",
            "Anyone with an index of 30 or higher is considered obese .",
            "For example , a person who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 164 pounds has an index of 25 .",
            "If that person weighs 197 pounds , the index is 30 .",
            "The report recommends that moderately overweight people should at least try to stabilize their weight .",
            "If they have other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes , they should lose weight .",
            "For obese people , the report said , weight loss is essential .",
            "Between the ages of 20 and 60 , we gain an average of half a pound per year .",
            "But being overweight is afflicting people of all ages .",
            "Sixty percent of overweight children have a medical complication such as elevated cholesterol , triglycerides or insulin levels , a new study shows , said William Dietz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .",
            "Children have been losing opportunities for physical activity because their parents are less likely to let them walk to school , and schools are less likely to emphasize physical education , Dietz said .",
            "The more television children watch , the more likely they are to be obese , Dietz said .",
            "And the TV-obesity relationship has grown stronger in the last 20 years .",
            "The elderly also are joining the ranks of the obese in greater numbers .",
            "`` When many people think of elderly persons , they think of tiny , frail people , '' said Gordon Jensen , associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University .",
            "`` They 're actually frail , big people . ''",
            "Jensen is conducting research on more than 12,500 elderly residents of rural Pennsylvania , about one third of whom are obese .",
            "He has found that as their weight goes up , so does the likelihood that the person has trouble walking or climbing stairs , or even getting into and out of a car .",
            "These elderly , he said , `` are often trapped in their homes , ca n't bathe themselves , ca n't dress themselves . ''",
            "People who are obese in old age tended to be overweight and sedentary in middle age as well and continued gaining weight into their 50s and 60s , Jensen said .",
            "That does n't bode well for the future , he said .",
            "`` Guess who 's right behind them ?",

            "The National Institutes of Health spends $ 100 million per year on obesity research , she said .",
            "But that amount is dwarfed by the $ 1 billion spent on cardiovascular disease research and the $ 2 billion spent on cancer research .",
            "Insurance companies often will not cover obesity treatment , she said .",
            "In many cases doctors helping a patient lose weight may have to seek reimbursement by treating the patient 's obesity-related diseases .",
            "Medicare and Medicaid do not cover obesity treatment , Stern said .",
            "The armed services do not offer treatment for obesity , but the condition can lead to a less-than-honorable discharge , she said .",
            "Obesity treatment is one of just two categories of medical care the Internal Revenue Service has ruled ineligible for tax deductions , Stern said .",
            "The other category is cosmetic plastic surgery .",
            "But however much medical treatment becomes available to individual patients , it wo n't stop the obesity epidemic , Brownell of Yale said .",
            "To do that , there must be social action to change the country 's `` toxic food environment , '' he said .",
            "This environment has been created by a food industry that encourages people to eat too much of the wrong foods , Brownell said .",
            "For example , fast food is being offered in school lunchrooms , Brownell said .",
            "`` Can we do anything worse in our schools ?",
            "This is second only to having cigarette machines in our schools , '' he said .",
            "Brownell proposed changing America 's eating habits by levying a tax on junk food and offering fruit and vegetables at a government subsidized discount .",
            "He also called for regulating food advertising , particularly to children , the same way tobacco advertising is controlled .",

            "UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a `` fat epidemic , '' and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese .",
            "The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever , especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems , including heart disease , respiratory disease , diabetes and even some forms of cancer .",
            "`` Being overweight is not just a personal problem but a genuine public health threat , '' said University of Colorado obesity researcher James O. Hill in the May issue of the journal `` Science . ''",

            "What is known : Obesity is caused by a complicated interaction of environmental and genetic factors .",
            "Up until 20 years ago , obesity was considered less a disease and more the end result of gluttony and a sedentary lifestyle .",
            "Consuming more calories than you burn off is still the primary factor in most cases of obesity .",
            "But geneticists now are recognizing that heredity plays a salient role also .",
            "Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the area of obesity and genetics .",
            "For the past 30 years , the Gila River Pimas have agreed to participate in generational studies on obesity .",
            "The Pimas , as a group , have an unusually high incidence of obesity , which also has contributed to their highest recorded rates of diabetes in the world .",
            "A Gila River Pima man has an 80 percent chance of becoming diabetic before he 's 55 , according to Dr. David Harrowe , a public health officer for the tribe .",
            "Obesity researcher Dr. Eric Ravussin , formerly with the National Institutes of Health in the Phoenix area , has studied the Pimas , and was the focus of the February '98 `` New Yorker '' magazine article `` The Pima Paradox . ''",
            "He believes the Pimas ' plight is tied closely to their genetic inheritance .",
            "`` As desert dwellers , the Pima evolved `` thrifty '' fat genes as a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of famine , '' Ravussin said .",
            "As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods of cholla-cactus buds , honey mesquite , prickly pears and tepary beans , squash and white-winged dove , their weight was kept in check during normal times .",
            "But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to eat like other Americans , and in mass quantities like other Americans , their thrifty fat genes became a liability .",
            "Their new higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized , according to Ravussin .",
            "Geneticist Murray Brilliant , a professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson , said it 's not exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima population .",
            "`` But , obviously , in every population there are people who have more thrifty genes than other people , '' Brilliant said .",
            "`` If that was n't the case , then everybody who ate the same thing would be the same weight . ''",
            "There 's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to hormonal irregularities .",
            "Obesity specialist Dr. Donald Robertson of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale , Ariz. , said the consensus among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine organ .",
            "`` Like a thyroid or adrenal , it produces its own hormone , called leptin , '' Robertson said .",
            "`` Understanding how leptin works seems to be a key in treating obesity . ''",
            "It 's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop eating , which creates the sensation of satiation , or feeling full .",
            "However , this signal does not get through properly in some overweight people .",
            "Consequently , scientists have tried to inject synthetic leptin , hoping this would stimulate the satiation response .",
            "But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone leptin is n't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be .",
            "Endocrinologist Dr. Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas and obesity .",
            "His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that obesity has a physiological basis .",
            "`` I do n't think there 's any question that obesity is a disease , '' Tataranni said .",
            "`` It 's a matter of understanding how hormones stimulate different areas of the brain . ''",
            "On occasion , obesity research has turned up the unexpected .",
            "A London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological behavior .",
            "People who are overweight often say they do n't understand their weight gain because they `` practically eat nothing at all . ''",
            "Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically underestimate their food intake ( up to 50 percent ) , especially the high caloric , fatty foods .",
            "`` We do n't know if it 's lying or a subconscious omission , '' said head researcher Dr. Berit Heitmann .",
            "In either case , researchers in the study concluded that denial further impedes chances for weight loss .",
            "It 's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate factors have in the overall obesity package .",
            "But Harrowe , the Pima public health officer , feels emphasizing factors we ca n't control does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight .",
            "`` What you do n't want is people developing this attitude that there 's nothing they can do about it anyway , '' Harrowe said .",
            "`` You have to focus on lifestyle changes . ''",
            "Many obesity researchers agree , and believe that the fat epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that places inordinate emphasis on quantity .",
            "`` Becoming obese is a normal response to the American environment , '' said obesity researcher Hill .",
            "Hill , director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado , puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture : Americans have too much food available ; social and work situations encourage overeating ; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings ; 64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce bottled soda ; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise .",
            "Ravussin , formerly with the National Institutes of Health , agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the pathoenvironment .",

            "`` But the same can be said for non-Pimas .",
            "Getting food was hard work until 100 years ago .",
            "Now , it 's available in abundance without any activity required to obtain it . ''",
            "Robertson , of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center , said he 'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the largest soft drink under a buck .",
            "He said he 'd also like restaurants to be more responsible in the portions they serve .",
            "`` You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a normal meal and you get enough for three people , '' Robertson said .",

            "What 's more promising , say West and other gene scientists _ are drugs targeted to specific genetic switches in the body 's metabolic machine that keeps weight and energy in balance .",
            "Such `` magic bullet '' therapies are a long way off , but the investment of money and scientific energy is enormous .",
            "`` It is quite a race , '' says Louis Tartaglia , a scientist at Millennium Pharmaceuticals , a Cambridge biotech company heavily invested in obesity gene research .",
            "Last week , Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent .",
            "The mutant gene , called mahogany , makes a protein that 's involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much fat the body stores .",
            "The discovery brings to over a dozen the number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years that influence an animal 's weight-gaining tendencies .",
            "It 's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects the mice against diet-induced obesity .",
            "But researchers are confident they will in time be able to trace the different biochemical pathways involved in weight control , and hope to be able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be the important regulatory devices in this system .",
            "`` Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene is defective , we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug development , '' Dr. Karen Moore , Millennium 's director of genetic systems said when making the announcement last week .",
            "`` In developing a drug , it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it , The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field .",
            "Not only does it suggest that similar genes in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay thin , but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that would n't require the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet .",
            "Even if counterparts exist in humans , however , it wo n't be that simple to pick apart the human weight control system .",
            "`` The majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would explain their obesity , '' says Tartaglia , the Millennium scientist .",
            "More likely , he says , is that human weight is governed by a large number of genes , each one of which has only a modest effect , in combination with environmental factors .",
            "The stakes are enormous , both in terms of improving the nation 's health _ some 55 percent , or 97 million _ of Americans are overweight and obese _ but also gathering profits for biotech and pharmaceutical companies .",
            "This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New York 's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a gene , called ob , which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to be obese .",
            "The protein , dubbed leptin , helps regulate weight and food intake by signaling the brain to create a `` full '' feeling in th person .",
            "Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some , or perhaps many , obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their brains fail to signal them to stop eating .",
            "So , the reasoning went , give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and cause them to lose weight .",
            "A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen , Inc. , in California , was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical trials .",
            "Reportedly the results have been disappointing , although the compound has worked for some of the volunteers .",
            "Moreover , it 's been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin : it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal is n't getting to the right receiving station .",
            "Since the leptin gene discovery , scientists have found a number of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight and energy balance .",
            "Each of these gene alterations provide clues to how mammals ' weight is controlled , but none has led to a drug so far .",
            "Still , the discovery of the ob gene was `` a real breakthrough , because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease , '' says Judith Stern , a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California in Davis .",
            "How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the market is anybody 's guess .",
            "`` We do n't know the final chapter _ we 're just learning about the puzzle '' of weight regulation , says Stern .",
            "However , she says , `` we ca n't wait until we identify all the genes _ we have to do something now '' about the obesity epidemic .",
            "Stern , a founder of the American Obesity Association , an advocacy group , says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make obesity a high priority for research and public policy .",
            "Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields dramatic results soon or not , says Stern , `` it 's giving the disease of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of compassion '' for the overweight ."

            "BOSTON _ Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States , with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese , a top US health official said Friday .",
            "Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing the nation today , yet the best way to attack this mounting problem has not been devised , said Dr. William H. Dietz , director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .",
            "`` We 're on our way to solving the tobacco problem .",
            "The next major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction , '' said Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health Association .",
            "Considering that obesity and related health problems consume about 6 percent of the national health care budget , as estimated by one recent Harvard study , `` not to do anything about obesity and physical inactivity is very expensive , '' Dietz said .",
            "To indicate the intractability of the problem , Dietz and other speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds and the difficulty in shedding them .",
            "Between 1963 and 1994 , for instance , the average weight of 10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds , as a result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being consumed over that time period , according to statistics that Dietz has calculated but not yet published .",
            "The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman , who gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time period .",
            "A 35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that period , by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day , according to Dietz 's calculations , which are based on complex formulas including average expenditures through physical activity .",
            "To put the additional calories per day in perspective , a banana provides about 80 calories .",
            "In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent obesity , particularly among children , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years , adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height measurements , according to Dietz .",
            "The body-mass index , or BMI , has been considered a better measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and height charts .",
            "The growth charts , a staple of pediatricians ' offices and parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the same age , will allow the plotting of a child 's BMI against that of other children of the same age .",
            "`` That 's a big deal , '' Dietz said .",
            "In Massachusetts , as elsewhere in the nation , low-income children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional problems .",
            "Elizabeth Metallinos-Katsaras , director of Pediatric and Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance for the State Department of Public Health , presented 1996 data on 128,000 low-income Massachusetts children under the age of five in the government nutritional program Woman , Infants , and Children .",
            "More than 25 percent of the children had low hemoglobin levels , an indication of anemia , while the percentage of children who were overweight was more than twice as high as expected , 10.5 percent .",
            "Only 5 percent were expected to be overweight .",
            "Preliminary 1997 figures , to be released in the next couple of months , suggest a slight decrease in the percentage of overweight children in WIC , but the numbers for low hemoglobin , short stature , and being under weight appear to be holding steady , Metallinos-Katsaras said in an interview ."

            "Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight , a rate much higher than Asian or European nations , says Melanie Polk , a registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer Research , a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link between diet and cancer .",
            "Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed , the average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002 .",
            "If exercise levels remain equal , that translates into a weight gain of 15 pounds a year , according to the National Institutes of Health .",
            "`` A major reason people are getting bigger , '' Polk says , `` is that their servings have gotten larger , and commercial food portions are a major culprit . ''",
            "French fries from McDonald 's offer a clear example of the phenomenon .",
            "An order of supersized fries has 540 calories and 26 grams of fat .",
            "When the company began selling french fries in the 1950s , a small order _ the only one available _ had 220 calories and 12 grams of fat .",
            "The institute also & LR ; recently & LR ; surveyed croissants & LR ; , quesadillas & LR ; and bagels , popular & LR ; American & LR ; foods adopted from other countries .",
            "In each case , the item grew in size and calories when it was adapted for the American market .",
            "The average Parisian croissant weighs slightly more than an ounce and is about 15 inches in circumference .",
            "The typical American-style croissant weighs almost twice that and measures 181/2 inches .",
            "And American-made croissants tend to have more sugar and fat , Polk says .",
            "The bagel , seen as a healthy alternative to fattier breakfast pastries , has ballooned since its birth in Eastern Europe .",
            "Even in its first 60 years in America , it stayed small and close to its European cousins _ about 11/2 to two ounces .",
            "But today some bagels have more than doubled in size .",
            "National bagel-maker Lender offers a 41/2-ounce `` Big and Crusty '' bagel ; Dunkin Donuts ' plain bagel is four ounces .",
            "And people rarely eat bagels plain .",
            "Adding fat-laden spreads like cream cheese and peanut butter boost the caloric content .",
            "And the bigger the bagel , the more spread it can take .",
            "& LR ; Quesadillas have also morphed into calorie bombs since their immigration from Mexico , Polk says .",
            "Small corn tortillas filled with potato , cheese and beans are common in northern Mexico , and cheese and chicken in five-inch corn tortillas are popular in other parts .",
            "But in America , the most common quesadilla is a 10-inch flour tortilla filled with cheese .",
            "Polk estimates the typical American-style quesadilla contains more than 1,200 calories and 70 grams of fat .",
            "& LR ; In other studies , nutritionists and researchers are nudging out the concept of `` bad foods '' like soda and fat in favor of focusing on the huge portion issue .",
            "Two soda-consumption studies released this spring by researchers from Georgetown and Michigan State universities showed that overweight children consumed only two ounces more of sugared , carbonated soft drinks than than children who were n't overweight , and that soft drinks have not replaced milk in children 's diets .",
            "`` If we want a villain to blame for increases in childhood obesity , then we should point our fingers at the real culprits _ huge portions of food and a lack of physical activity , '' says Maureen Storey of the & LR ; Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition Policy .",
            "Calls to eliminate certain foods is n't a practical way to help children or adults lose weight , she says .",
            "`` We should get over this good food-bad food silliness and move on . ''"
