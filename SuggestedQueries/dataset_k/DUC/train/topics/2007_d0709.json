            "The white and silver racer-back gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms. Jolie has to offer that it seemed she had already been dipped in water .",
            "Awards shows like the Golden Globes , which took place last month , have become a huge influence on fashion , previewing what designers are likely to put on runways and stimulating sales .",
            "Ms. Jolie 's dress , by Randolph Duke , turned up in his show last Friday .",
            "The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston 's Kevan Hall put on Christine Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace gowns he presented last week for fall .",
            "And the black and white outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long trumpet skirts on the catwalk , including one in rich ruby sequins .",
            "But on the whole , evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999 are a demure bunch .",
            "There was plenty of beauty worthy of the Oscars , the Golden Globes or even the Grammys , which offer a chance for more fashion-watching tomorrow night , but little to elicit heart palpitations .",
            "This design approach suited the moment well , for with a few exceptions , it was a sexless season .",
            "Not that celibate fashion is bad .",
            "It 's just different .",
            "Tommy Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan , in her Daryl K collection , ripped with wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum .",
            "As American as cornflakes , Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret .",
            "He gives enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely this side of Kmart oblivion .",
            "To the sounds of a live rock band , Sugar Ray , the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection , the designer sent men 's and women 's clothes rocking down the runway together .",
            "His mix of sports , music and high fashion was a potent brew , especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white stitching .",
            "The collection was further elevated by terrific fur vests , python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and wool fit for a biker princess .",
            "Ms. Kerrigan 's collection was a pirate 's treasure worth of creativity .",
            "There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her inspirational mother lode .",
            "It was war .",
            "She masterfully rolled the concept into her funky street-wear esthetic , with parachute nylon jackets over slim pants , holey sweaters and shorts over trousers .",
            "Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models ' faces .",
            "That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising given that Ms. Kerrigan hails from Ireland , where an awareness of violence is never far from mind .",
            "Whether it was Ireland or the millennium that drove her , the results were masterly .",
            "The pretty , festive clothes of the many designers who showed evening wear in the last days of the shows , which ended Friday , balanced the aggressive message of designers like Ms. Kerrigan .",
            "In his second season as chief designer for Halston , Hall made a short excursion into day wear , and it was most promising : a studded chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding ; a lush vanilla frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt .",
            "Beaded tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing .",
            "There were , though , unnecessarily mundane gowns , like a black velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row Hall was playing to .",

            "Understatement permeated Vera Wang 's collection , as if earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear .",
            "Ms. Wang offered gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm fronds .",
            "Throughout the collections , designers of evening wear have pushed the idea of knits for after 8 , and Ms. Wang handily paired skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos , infusing the collection with a very American spirit .",
            "A wonderful impact of the American shows ' going first on the international calendar ( London , Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks ) was that designers plumbed American culture and style rather than European .",
            "This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences .",
            "There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere , at Ms. Wang 's show and at Duke 's .",
            "It was uplifting to see Duke back on the runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer .",
            "In the audience were his new backers , Juliana Holt and her husband , Peter , who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association .",
            "Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _ off-the-shoulder , bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing them with pave gowns , beaded skirts and , prettiest of all , debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors .",
            "But Duke 's decision to use all Asian , Eurasian and Afro-Asian models was regrettable .",
            "Making race a part of an esthetic unwittingly paves the way for Asian , Latina or African models to be left out in the cold when their look does n't work with the mood of the season , as has happened before .",
            "Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of view without typecasting .",
            "Fresh and original , Ms. Tam incorporated futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face , luminous sparkly dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades , and Chinese spiritual icons embroidered onto T-shirts .",
            "Ms. Tam had her false starts , but she is unquestionably pointed toward the future .",
            "Not so , Ms. Feng , who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual , turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection .",
