it held in Tehran, Amsterdam, and Beirut, the names of those who planned and carried out the assassination, the centers where they were trained, their affiliations, and how this leads to exposing dangerous secrets which made the Abu-Nidal group send threat letters to those in charge of the investigation.", "A few days ago, Palestinian Ahmad Mahmud 'Abd-al-Karim, a prominent FRC official, arrived in Lebanon from Finland on the special mission of following up the investigations the Lebanese authorities are conducting with the Palestinians from the Abu-Nidal group who are accused of the assassination of Jordanian First Secretary Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut on 29 January.", "Reports confirm that shortly after arriving in Beirut, Ahmad 'Abd-al-Karim left for the FRC's al-Rawdah camps in Western al-Biqa' from where he followed the investigation through reports sent to him by people who secretly work for the FRC and who provided him with information in exchange for generous sums of money.", "Reports say that some officials in the Lebanese security organs have links with the Abu-Nidal group.", "At the same time, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that the Abu- Nidal group recently sent threat letters to Lebanese officials who are currently investigating its members who are involved in the al- Ma'ayitah assassination.", "These are: Yusuf Sha'ban, Bassam Muhammad 'Attiyah, and Yusuf 'Udwani, codenamed Salim Mahyub.", "Lebanese investigator, Judge Sa'id Mirza ordered the arrest of the three Palestinians and listened to the deposition of three witnesses, including 'Afaf Yusuf

coordination with the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic Mobilization Youth Organization [IMYO] which is financed by Iran.", "The IMYO was exposed in Jordan by Jordanian authorities on 17 August 1992 when the Jordanian security bodies confiscated weapons and ammunition the organization had been hiding in Jordan to be used to destablize the regime and security in the country.", "During the trials, this organization tried to claim that the weapons found by the authorities were temporarily hidden in Jordan but were to be smuggled into the occupied territories and given to the Palestinian strugglers there to enhance their ability to confront the Zionist forces and carry out military operations against them.", "The IMYO also claimed that the weapons that were found were not brought in

organization.", "The security information the investigators have collected on the al-Ma'ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the IMYO was exposed, Jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to

suitable atmosphere and the appropriate place to carry out their activities in cooperation with Hizballah.", "The information gathered also shows that some Jordanian fundamentalist elements moved to

has sponsored these organizations to establish Islamic organizations and cells in the countries that have common borders with Israel so they can take power in these countries and turn them into Islamic regimes.", "Since that time, Iran exploited the elements from these fundamentalist organizations and established the Jordan office in the Liberation Movement's office.", "Ayatollah Shakhiry

elements held an important meeting in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with officials from the FRC.", "The official in charge of the Jordanian elements was Shakir Abu-Jami', a Jordanian national wanted by authorities in his country and one of the most prominent members of the Jordanian fundamentalist Muhammad Army Organization.", "Abu-Jami' now lives in Sa'dah, Yemen, which is home to camps for Afghan and Arab fundamentalists.", "The information adds that the IMYO made several decisions to attack Jordanian interests and institutions and assassinate Jordanian diplomats in a move to pressure the Jordanian regime.", "The information says that the scheme was designed some two years ago and the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Jordan refused to get involved in it because of the danger and because the Brotherhood Movement does not agree with the proposals of other fundamentalist organizations.", "Iran managed to recruit FRC members to work in the Jordanian fundamentalist extremist organizations by taking advantage of the hostility the Abu-Nidal group has harbored against Jordan and its regime and king ever since the group was expelled from the country.", "The information confirms that Abu-Nidal group's leadership agreed to execute the mission for the aforesaid reasons, because of its commitment to the policy of extremism and rejection that aims at torpedoing the [peace] process, and because of its ties to Iran within the framework of international terrorism.", "Detailing this cooperation that lead to al-Ma'ayitah's assassination, the security sources note that the al-Ramlah al- Bayda' area in Beirut contained a secret headquarters for Walid Khalid, the FRC official spokesman who was assassinated in the Lebanese capital on 30 July 1992.", "These meetings were conducted in

newspaper, provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace proposal made by the insurgents last fall.", "While the newspaper has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the Shining Path, the paper has also stressed that the peace called for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical retreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not, as President Alberto Fujimori has contended, an implicit admission of defeat.", "END SUMMARY Although La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, provided little information on the origins of the \"important and unusual\" document that it published in a special 25 January supplement, it assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining the Shining Path's \"struggle for a peace agreement\" was a genuine Shining Path statement.", "The paper claimed that the \"anonymous sources\" who supplied the \"secret\" document provided \"full authentication\" and that \"experts\" consulted by the paper also \"agreed\" that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman (La Republica, 26 January).", "(See Note 1) (Note 1) La Republica did not assert that the document was actually signed by Guzman.", "However, the paper did claim that the document was \"approved\" by imprisoned Shining Path Central Committee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Marta Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez and Rosa Angelica Salas de la Cruz (25 January).", "While the anti-Fujimori daily may have, at least in part, published the document to discredit President Fujimori, it contended that it was motivated by a desire to provide Peruvians with information on the peace proposal that had not been made available by the government.", "The paper declared that it was \"clearly\" its \"duty\" to publish the document \"given the mantle of silence that the government has cast\" over the peace negotiations (26 January).", "La Republica's publication of the Shining Path strategy statement follows by three months the October 1993 release by the Fujimori government of letters from Guzman calling for peace talks with the government (Radio Programs del Peru, 1 October 1993; Radio and TV, 4 October 1993; Global de Television, 10 October 1993; Panamericana Television, 30 October 1993).", "The Shining Path leadership's sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the government, just as the 31 October national referendum vote was approaching, raised questions in the media about whether the letters really represented authoritative Shining Path policy [see box].", "(See Note 2) (Note 2) Among other objectives, the narrowly successful referendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second successive term.", "Tactical Retreat for Guzman Implicitly rejecting Fujimori's claim that the Shining Path's call for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political defeat by the insurgents, La Republica concluded that the movement's leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than a \"temporary ceasefire\" (25 January).", "(See Note 3) According to the daily's 26 January editorial, the Shining Path tract \"makes it clear\" that in the eyes of Abimael Guzman a \"peace agreement\" is simply an \"armed truce\" until after the year 2OOO, at which time the Shining Path \"would resume its bloodbath.\"", "La Republica offered a possible explanation for the insurgents' tactical retreat in a 3O January interview with a \"military and subversion analyst,\" who suggested-that a temporary withdrawal may offer Guzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political leader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned.", "Thee analyst concluded, therefore, that the insurgents' peace strategy represents \"an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's leadership\" and \"recognition that circumstances have changed.\"", "(Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording of Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the Shining Path \"political\" leadership \"has tacitly admitted that the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the Shining Path\" (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October 1993).", "Outlook La Republica's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders.", "At the same time, however, by concluding that the published strategy statement is merely the Shining Path's declaration of temporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the credibility of Fujimori's claim that the call for peace represents a victory for the government.", "While such doubts are unlikely to seriously affect Fujimori's prospects for reelection next year, they may have further tarnished the image of the Peruvian president, already damaged by his narrow victory in the constitutional referendum last October.", "BOX Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks, announced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October (Radio Programas del Peru, 1 October 1993), the conservative daily El Comercio reported that one seasoned political observer had warned\" that Guzman's \"reported\" desire \"to reach a peace agreement\" does not mean there is reason \"to claim a victory in the ongoing struggle against terrorism\" since, according to the observer, the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control the Shining Path (2 October 1993).", "-- Following the second Guzman letter, which supplemented the call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori's economic and political program (Lima Global de Television, 1O October 1993), a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas wrote that the government was using a \"broken\" Guzman \"in the campaign for the 'yes' vote\" for the upcoming referendum, adding that \"it is no coincidence that the letters ... have come out during the 3O days prior\" to the 31 October vote (14 October 1993).", "-- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter, an editorial in La Republica wondered whether \"government representatives,\" working to promote the \"yes\" vote on the referendum, had not \"fallen into a trap\" by thinking that Shining Path militants would take seriously such an \"unctuous\" call for peace talks as appeared in the letter (14 October 1993).", "-- Also in response to the second letter, Caretas on 14 October claimed that Fujimori was \"using\" Guzman \"in the campaign\" to win the 31 October referendum, noting that \"with Guzman's letters\" calling for peace talks, Fujimori's \"promise\" to wipe out the Shining Path by 1995 \"may gain credibility.\"", "END BOX (AUTHOR: ROLLINS.", "QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF ANALYST, EUROPE/LATIN AMERICA GROUP, (7O3) 733-612O.)", "ELAG/GILISON cka 17/0107z mar"]}, "summaries":

Feinberg calls the decline in investment the 'great shortcoming of structural adjustment lending in the 1980s'.", "(Investment to GNP ratios have fallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.)", "He says the bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of adjustment by increasing investment.", "How can the bank do better in the 1990s?", "One problem is that it has lost leverage over many Third World governments.", "The maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries.", "According to Mr Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next five years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s.", "For the large number of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans, the net flow will be negative.", "Some analysts, including US Treasury

South Korea.", "Most analysts, however, say the bank should tighten up a little.", "Mr Flickner of the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist on Westminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that 'loans will benefit the majority of the people'.", "Bank officials say greater attention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of decision-taking.", "Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the private sector?", "Mr Conable, to his credit, is resisting the US Treasury's pressure.", "He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing countries.", "In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is in spheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governments play a dominant role even in industrialised countries.", "Indeed, one conclusion of Prof Toye's analysis is that policy-based loans would have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand the role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote economic liberalisation.", "Sir William Ryrie, the head of the IFC, says the objective of a large volume of public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed.", "'What we are trying to do is facilitate the flow of private-sector funds into sound investments.'", "Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs; but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?", "There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development.", "During the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums.", "It wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently fashionable in the industrialised world.", "But the notion that economic liberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned.", "The bank's own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly and to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care.", "'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for International Economics, 'but education is more important.'", "He argues that the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to put resources into education and primary health care.", "Mr Feinberg at the Overseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development'.", "The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital.", "Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.", "Ideas are certainly important, but they do not build hospitals or schools.", "More money could be

Yugoslavia.", "Since Slovenia's declaration of independence in June 1991, the gap between the peaceful, ethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war-impoverished rest of former Yugoslavia has widened inexorably.", "'We have been very lucky,' says President Milan Kucan, the wily former communist who led Slovenia's drive for independence from the Serb- dominated federation.", "But he, like Mr Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister of Slovenia's three-pronged coalition government, makes clear that Slovenia suffers economically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and would be one of the principal gainers from a resolution of the bloody Balkan imbroglio.", "'Slovenia's southern border with Croatia has become the border between peace and war in Europe,' Mr Kucan declares.", "A glance at the map shows what he means.", "At its narrowest point, only a 46 km- long strip of Slovenian coast- line separates Italy from the rest of former Yugoslavia.", "Austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, both once ruled by the Austrian Habs- burgs, thanks to its own 324 km-long border with Slovenia.", "But Slovenia would hate to be perceived merely as a convenient cordon sanitaire.", "The new Karavanke road tunnel beneath the Alps, completed just before the 10-day war between Slovenia and the Yugoslav army which immediately followed indep- endence, has underlined Slovenia's traditional importance as a transit route.", "The railways and the motorway leading south through the capital Ljubljana to the Slovenian port of Koper and its Italian neighbour Trieste carry freight and travellers heading to and from central Europe and the Adriatic sea.", "The highway is also thick with aid trucks and an ever-decreasing volume of 'normal' cargoes moving south-east towards Croatia.", "Independence has, above all, brought peace to Slovenia and left it free to implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war further south.", "Economists, however, are quick to point out that independence has its costs.", "Slovenia, with its self- contained infrastructure and proximity to western markets, was always by far the richest republic of the former federation.", "Its per capita GDP of around Dollars 6,000 was three times higher than that of Serbia and five times that of Kosovo, the poorest region of the former Yugoslavia.", "Slovenia has always had a strong tourism industry of its own.", "But it also benefited from the overnight stays of foreign tourists heading further south to Croatia's Dalmatian coast.", "Now the once-thriving seaside hotels are filled with discons- olate refugees and Croatia's main source of hard currency income has disappeared.", "So have the transit tourists through Slovenia.", "Above all, Slovene enterprises were able to build up exports to the rest of Europe, thanks to the volume of sales they were able to make in Yugoslavia which virtually gave them a 22m strong domestic market.", "The UN embargo on trade with Serbia means both the loss of the largest of the former Yugoslav markets and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials and other inputs.", "These helped restrain costs and improve competitiveness in more demanding hard currency markets.", "Now Slovenia has to lower real wages and increase productivity in order to compensate.", "On the positive side of the balance sheet, however, the end of the federal state means that Slovenia no longer has to contribute over Dollars 1bn a year to finance the bloated Yugoslav army or see its hard currency deposits 'frozen' by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, as happened before independence.", "Relations with Croatia, Slovenia's southern neighbour, are generally good but they are complicated by three contentious issues.", "The first of these is the border itself, which is disputed in parts.", "The second issue contains Croatia's share of the running costs of the Krsko nuclear plant on Slovenian territory.", "The plant was built and financed jointly to supply electricity to both republics but financially hard-pressed Croatia is now reluctant to pay its share of the running costs.", "The third outstanding issue concerns compensation for the assets of Ljubljanska Banka in Croatia.", "There is no nostalgia for the old Yugoslavia, which Slovenes tried without success to trans- form into a looser confederal structure.", "But a mixture of compassion for the suffering of their fellow southern Slavs and economic loss ensures that the Slovene authorities, while categorically ruling out any possibility of resuming old political ties with former Yugoslavia, pray, without much hope, for a quick and lasting solution to the conflict and the resumption of normal economic ties.", "The war, with its violent and deliberate displacement of millions of people, has and is taking place in the ethnically mixed border lands of Croatia and Bosnia relatively distant from the Slovene border.", "Both Mr Kucan and Mr Drnovsek, who headed the old revolving Yugoslav state presidency for a year before negotiating the exodus of the federal army from Slovenia in July 1991, criticise the failure of the west to intervene more forcibly to stop at an early stage what Mr Kucan calls 'the war of aggression waged by Serbia.'", "The president is particularly scathing against what he calls the west's definition of the war in Bosnia as a civil or ethnic war.", "'Of course the people who are dying do not care how it is defined.", "But for the inter- national community it is essential to define it as a war of aggression against a UN- recognised state and draw the appropriate conclusions.", "It is a tragedy that Bosnia's elected leader has now been reduced by the international com- munity to merely one of sev- eral ethnic leaders,' he adds.", "Preventing the war in parts of former Yugoslavia destabilising Slovenia and scaring off tourists remains a top priority for the new republic.", "The border with Croatia is now in effect sealed against further immigation after 70,000 refugees, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of the local population, were taken in.", "Refugees are housed and cared for by local authorities around the country, often in former Yugoslav army barracks, at an annual cost of around Dollars 250m.", "Many are expected to stay even after the war ends.", "Meanwhile, the coalition government which emerged from last December's elections to the national parliament and parallel presidential elections, is determined to use its four-year mandate to complete the transformation of the country into a fully-fledged, market-orientated, multi-party parliamentary democracy.", "At the core of the government is an alliance between the Liberal Democrats, headed by Mr Drnovsek, which emerged as the largest single party with 25 per cent of seats in parliament, and the Christian Democrats led by Mr Lojze Peterle, the foreign minister.", "But the coalition also includes the four party 'associated list', made up principally of reformed communists.", "This helps to give the coalition a wider parliamentary base.", "The inclusion of the 'left- wing' parties, with their traditional links to workers and the trade unions showed its value last month when they twice gave their assent to a new wages pact designed to reduce real incomes.", "Independent economists calculate that average real incomes have to fall around 10 per cent from current levels of around DM650 a month if the Slovenian economy is to compete effectively for new markets in the west and attract foreign investment.", "Both are needed to reverse the rise in unemployment and build on the structural reforms to the banking system and privatisation which are currently under way.", "The next four years will be crucial.", "But much has been achieved in the first 20 months of independence - including the establishment of a parliamentary democracy and a virtually convertible independent currency, the Slovene tolar, backed by strong reserves.", "The new republic is peaceful, internationally recognised and a member of the most important inter- national institutions.", "By the end of the century it wants to be eligible for full membership of an enlarged European Community.", "As elsewhere in the region, privatisation
