            "El Nino and La Nina , the warmer and colder phases of a perpetual oscillation in the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean that drastically affects weather around the world , have in recent years become familiar agents of short-term climate change .",
            "Now some scientists believe they may have identified a comparable kind of oscillation involving deep ocean currents .",
            "They say this oscillation could warm and cool substantial parts of the globe on longer time scales of centuries to millenniums .",
            "The deep ocean currents , in effect , create a global conveyor belt that transports great amounts of heat around the world .",
            "When the currents run strongly , for example , Western Europe and the North Atlantic region are relatively warm ; when they are weak , they cool off .",
            "One instance of this cooling , some experts now suspect , was what is called the little ice age , an intermittent cold spell from the 14th to 19th centuries that at its coldest sent glaciers coursing down mountain slopes and condemned much of Europe to famine by freezing harvests .",
            "Two years ago , researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University discovered that cold spells lasting several centuries , much like the little ice age , have occurred regularly , about every 1,400 to 1,500 years , since the end of the last full ice age some 10,000 years ago .",
            "Much bigger temperature swings , they found , occurred at the same intervals during the ice age itself .",
            "They discovered this by analyzing climate signals contained in ocean sediments in the North Atlantic .",
            "Now , by putting together different sorts of evidence , other researchers led by Dr. Wallace S. Broecker , a marine geochemist at Lamont-Doherty , have postulated that the oscillations in deep-ocean currents may be responsible for the 1,500-year cold cycles .",
            "The study by Broecker and Stewart Sutherland of Lamont-Doherty and Tsung-Hung Peng of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appears in the current issue of the journal Science .",
            "While there is a long way to go before Broecker 's postulate can be proved or disproved , it appeared to provide a possible new explanation for what Dr. Richard Alley , a climate expert at Pennsylvania State University , called `` a fundamental beat to the climate . ''",
            "He said Broecker had `` put together a very possible story . ''",
            "`` We need good hypotheses , '' Alley said , `` and he 's given us one . ''",
            "Discerning and explaining the climate 's fundamental beat is important to a central climate question of the day : whether the atmosphere is warming because of natural changes or human-induced changes in the atmosphere , chiefly emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases , like carbon dioxide .",
            "Broecker is a primary advocate of the concept of the ocean conveyor belt as a climate regulator .",
            "The conveyor is believed to be driven by changes in the salt content of the ocean 's surface .",
            "When salt builds up in a particular spot in the North Atlantic , it eventually makes the water dense enough to sink to the ocean depths .",
            "Other water rushes in to replace it at the surface .",
            "This combination is what sets the conveyor moving .",
            "The bigger and stronger the main conveyor current , the more heat it can transport .",
            "Aside from the North Atlantic , there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water ( scientists call this production of deep water ) : the Weddell Sea near Antarctica .",
            "By combining the results of a number of recent chemical and physical studies by several scientists , Broecker has concluded that the two sites do not produce roughly the same amount of deep water all the time , as had been thought .",
            "Rather , he says , the southern and northern sites alternate as strong producers : when one is giving a strong boost to the conveyor , the other is giving a weak one , with widespread consequences for climate .",
            "A number of studies of past climates have shown that when the North Atlantic region has been cold , as in the end of the last ice age , Antarctica has been relatively warm .",
            "And a recent study by Dr. Gary Clow , a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey in Denver , based on an analysis of ancient Antarctic ice , suggests that since the end of the last glaciation , Antarctica was warmer whenever Europe was colder , as in the little ice age .",
            "Finally , chemical evidence shows that the production of deep water off Antarctica has slowed to about a third of its rate a century or so ago , when the little ice age was ending , while production has remained strong in the North Atlantic .",
            "That means the conveyor belt in that region continues to draw heat from the south to warm the North Atlantic region , especially Western Europe .",
            "No firm cause-and-effect link has been established between the conveyor 's supposed oscillations and the 1,500-year recurrences of cold spells like the little ice age .",
            "But Broecker says there is a clear relationship between the conveyor 's behavior and climate oscillations in the last ice age .",
            "And he says that if the conveyor has indeed oscillated since then , as now seems the case , it suggests that the link may have persisted .",
            "It is , he says , `` consistent with the idea that changes in the large-scale circulation in the ocean can have very important effects on the atmosphere , '' and that `` we 're playing with a system that we still do n't understand . ''"

            "State authorities who oversee Lake George say 150 boats were sunk when Tropical Storm Floyd was over , and all have been recovered .",
            "Divers , however , say it might have been more like 200 .",

            "What is true , however , is that over the centuries ships have gone down to storms and in battles ; others were deliberately scuttled in the days before strict laws forbade such sinkings .",
            "One vessel , a 15-foot homemade submarine built to study French and Indian War wrecks , was stolen from its dock in 1960 before it even made a trial run .",

            "But here are some mysteries that endure : _ In the deep water along the `` narrows '' at midlake , a 60-foot sailing vessel with a 65-foot mast is believed to be submerged , its sides collapsed , an open safe lying next to the wreck .",
            "Its existence is not confirmed .",
            "_ It is said that a treasure chest was found by two divers south of Diamond Island , near where the Forward wreck lies .",
            "Divers say the chest is sunk in 120 feet of water and some continue to search for it today , but others note that waters off the island do not exceed 110 feet .",
            "_ In the 1850s , a storm took down a three-mast sailing vessel ( known as a `` bark '' ) in the middle of the lake with its full crew aboard .",
            "One man jumped off before the storm became too powerful , and lived to tell a tale of violent winds and a crew member who tied himself to the mast to ride out the storm .",
            "The ship has never been found .",
            "_ The British vessel Halifax , a sloop-of-war , disappeared and may be somewhere in Lake George .",
            "Over 50 feet long , it participated in both the 1758 Abercrombie expedition and the 1759 Amherst expedition .",
            "Some historians believe it was dragged ashore and left to rot .",
            "_ What ever became of the Ganouskie ?",
            "The steamboat was a lake attraction in the mid-19th century , then retired and moored at Big Burnt Island , where it was a floating bar .",
            "When the bar failed , it is said the ship was scuttled in deep water off Dome Island , near Bolton Landing .",
            "Divers are still making discoveries in Lake George .",

            "TEL AVIV , Israel ( AP ) -- Phoenician mariners sailed more than 2,500 years ago into the uncertain waters of the Mediterranean , praying to their storm god for a successful voyage -- only to meet death in a fierce tempest .",
            "Now , American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two ships -- the world 's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the same techniques he used to find the Titanic .",
            "The vessels ' cargo -- large ceramic containers of wine -- was probably headed to the Pharaoh 's table in Egypt or to the Phoenician colony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia , Ballard told a news conference Wednesday , in announcing the discovery .",
            "The ships ' contents indicate they set sail from the Phoenician port of Tyre -- now a city in Lebanon -- around 750 B.C .",

            "Remarkably , the amphorae were found intact , stacked snugly in rows , unlike the shards typically unearthed on land .",
            "Archaeologist Lawrence Stager , one of several Harvard University scientists on Ballard 's team , said the discovery of the pristine jugs `` was one of our greatest moments . ''",

            "The fact that they sank straight to the bottom and were located within two miles of each other indicated they sank in a storm , Ballard said .",
            "Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians , and he hopes to find more ancient wrecks along the same path .",
            "One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45 feet .",
            "The vessels were probably part of a fleet of cargo ships on consignment , Stager said .",
            "Stone anchors were found , as well as crockery , a wine decanter and incense stands for offering prayers to the weather gods .",
            "Incense offerings were made at the beginning and end of every voyage , but Stager said desperate sailors might also have used the incense stands during the violent storm that sank the boats .",
            "Based on the pots and crockery found aboard , Stager said he believed there were about a half-dozen sailors on each ship and that fish stew would have been a typical meal for the crew .",
            "Ballard said the two vessels were the first intact Phoenician ships ever found , and will aid historians and archaeologists , who until now had to rely on classical texts and the Bible for an idea about Phoenician shipping .",
            "Phoenicians were a seafaring people who lived along the Levantine coast for about 2,000 years , beginning in 2300 B.C .",

Goff of the University of Texas said in an article in the May issue of the journal Geology that the recently discovered cracks could mean the continental shelf was unstable and could slide down like an avalanche , inducing the giant waves .",

            "The sea has millions of dark secrets .",
            "And now , a famous explorer is to illuminate more of them .",
            "For more than a third of a century , Alvin , the world 's first craft to roam the abyss with relative ease , has been ferrying American scientists into the planet 's sunless depths and racking up a staggering record of discovery , including dark ecosystems that , with riots of tube worms and other bizarre creatures , rival rain forests in richness .",
            "But the plucky , white , 25-foot-long craft has its shortcomings .",
            "Most notably , it can plunge down only so far without the deep 's pressures suddenly crushing its crew capsule ( and three occupants ) .",
            "For dives , the safety limit is 2.8 miles .",
            "That distance is little more than the sea 's average depth and far short of its deepest spot , seven miles down , much lower than Everest is high .",
            "The upshot is that a large part of the seabed , with its dark recesses and riddles and perhaps even a den or two of undiscovered monsters , is out of Alvin 's reach .",
            "Off limits is an area larger than Asia .",
            "But now , Alvin is getting a major overhaul that may extend its reach and allow it to match and possibly even surpass newer submersibles abroad , making it the world leader .",
            "In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , which runs Alvin , has just received from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff , which has been decommissioned in the wake of military cutbacks and changing priorities .",
            "Woods Hole and its federal patrons have insufficient money to run Sea Cliff , designed for military work , as a separate vehicle .",

            "So Woods Hole is now studying whether the capsule can be transferred to Alvin , a move that would extend the reach of the tiny submersible by a full mile .",
            "`` We have a responsibility to make sure it 's the best , '' Dr. Robert B. Gagosian , the director of Woods Hole , said in an interview .",
            "Eager to push even deeper and capitalize on the politics of the moment , the institution is seeing whether further strengthening would allow Alvin to plunge down to depths of 4.3 miles ( or 7 kilometers ) _ deeper than any of the rival submersibles now operated by Russia , France and Japan .",
            "`` We 've been the leaders in exploration , '' Dr. Gagosian said .",

            "Over the decades , Alvin users have been the first to glimpse the seabed 's dark ecosystems , its hot chimneys , its cold seeps , its rocky chains of mountains longer than the Andes and its lost human worlds , such as the Titanic .",
            "The explorers have also brought to light thousands of new species of animal life , including slimy things seemingly fit for monster movies .",

            "`` We do n't want to screw up the reliability in the process of trying to make the submersible better . ''",
            "When Alvin was first proposed by Woods Hole in the 1960s , it was considered a curiosity .",
            "Most military officials and scientists of the day cared little about people exploring the deep .",
            "No regular Navy contractor wanted job .",
            "So the submersible was built by General Mills , the maker of breakfast cereals .",
            "The situation changed after a Navy submarine , the Thresher , sank with 129 men in 1963 .",
            "Its wreckage remained lost for months .",
            "In the catastrophe 's wake , the Navy decided to throw itself into mastering the abyss .",
            "No expense was too great .",
            "The Navy built two Alvin look-alikes , Sea Cliff and Turtle .",
            "Both were heavier and faster than their forerunner .",
            "Eventually , in 1984 , Sea Cliff dove much deeper , with its stronger crew capsule .",
            "However , foreign submersibless began to rival Sea Cliff 's maximum depth of 3.8 miles and to make new discoveries .",
            "In 1990 , the Japanese pulled ahead with a new submersible that plunged down 4 miles .",
            "Woods Hole scientists looked on sheepishly in 1994 as the Japanese submersible , Shinkai 6500 , set an Atlantic depth record .",
            "Today , the 31-foot-long Japanese submersible is still unrivaled .",
            "Such competitive pressure is one reason Woods Hole is eager to have Alvin go deeper .",
            "The more important reason is raw knowledge .",
            "Scientists say the inky deep is not only inherently provocative but important to understand if people are to be good planetary stewards .",

            "Its voluminous waters supply vital elements that sustain life on the surface and regulate planetary heat flow , keeping the land temperate .",

            "About 90 percent of the Earth 's volcanism happens undersea .",
            "Gagosian , the Woods Hole director , said a deeper-diving Alvin could better study these cauldrons , which also support lush ecosystems and are suspected of being the place where life arose four billion years ago .",
            "A deeper-diving Alvin , he said , could not only explore the sites directly but could wire the ocean with sensitive detectors meant to track distant seaquakes .",
            "A great opportunity for such wiring lies in old telephone cables that criss-cross the sea 's abyssal plains , Gagosian said .",
            "This month , one such cable between California and Hawaii is to be lifted from a depth of 3.1 miles and fitted with geologic detectors _ an oceanographic first .",
            "A deeper Alvin could service such devices , eliminating the need for lifting the cable , which is a risky job .",
            "A deeper Alvin would also be able to visit more of humanity 's lost worlds .",
            "The luxury liner , Titanic , resting at a depth of more than two miles , is now within Alvin 's reach and was visited in 1986 by the tiny white submersible , but thousands of other wrecks lie deeper .",
            "One is the I-52 , a Japanese submarine sunk in World War II while carrying a shipment of two tons of gold , 146 bars of it packed in metal boxes .",
            "Discovered in 1995 more than three miles down on the Atlantic abyssal plain , the I-52 wreckage is now slated for further exploration as the salvage team searches for vehicles than can go that deep .",
            "Bits of Sea Cliff are already being transferred to Alvin .",
            "The first to go was the military submersible 's digital sonar .",
            "Barrie B. Walden , manager of deep submergence at Woods Hole , said incorporating Sea Cliff 's crew capsule into Alvin might cost $ 15 million , a sum as yet unapproved by federal planners .",
            "He said the upgrade could be done during the sub 's next major overhaul , which is scheduled for the end of 2000 , allowing it to start the new millennium on an auspicious note .",
            "With Alvin diving to depths of 3.8 miles ( or 6 kilometers ) , the region outside its reach would shrink dramatically , contracting from something larger than Asia to the size of Europe .",
            "Gagosian , eager for even greater penetration of the sea 's darkness , has asked Woods Hole experts to assess the feasibility of Alvin 's plunging to depths of 4.3 miles ( or 7 kilometers ) .",
            "But achieving that may take more than Sea Cliff 's sphere , and might cost $ 100 million _ big money in a field that gets about $ 20 million a year in federal money .",
            "Some scientists feel such money is unlikely to materialize .",
