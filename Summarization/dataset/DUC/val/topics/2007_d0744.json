            "Four years ago , he said that organic food could not feed the world without destroying the environment .",
            "Now , he says it 's lethal .",
            "In an article in the fall issue of American Outlook magazine , published by his employer , the Hudson Institute , a conservative research group , Avery wrote , `` Organic foods have clearly become the deadliest food choice . ''",
            "This is the case , he said , because organic farms use animal manure and do not use chemicals or permit pasteurization .",
            "The last assertion is untrue , as were several other statements in the article .",
            "The accusation might have gone unnoticed , but excerpts from the article were published in The Wall Street Journal and continue to be picked up around the country , by The Associated Press , The Tampa Tribune and trade industry publications .",
            "The simplest definition of `` organic '' is food grown without hormones , pesticides or synthetic fertilizers .",
            "Avery , however , used the terms `` organic , '' `` free-range , '' `` natural '' and `` unpasteurized '' interchangeably .",
            "`` I grant you that I 've mixed together natural and organic , '' Avery , the author of `` Saving the Planet With Pesticides and Plastic '' ( Hudson Institute , 1995 ) , said in an interview last week .",
            "`` But to me they are distinctions without significant difference in terms of public health . ''",
            "His most combative accusation is based , he said , on 1996 data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , showing that `` people who eat organic and ` natural ' foods are eight times as likely as the rest of the population to be attacked by a deadly new strain of E. coli bacteria ( O157 : H7 ) . ''",
            "Yet some of the foods that caused the outbreak , which he called organic , were not , like unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice .",
            "Avery 's claim that `` consumers of organic food are also more likely to be attacked by a relatively new , more virulent strain of the infamous salmonella bacteria '' was based on a Consumers Union study in 1998 showing that `` premium '' chickens had higher levels of salmonella than regular supermarket chickens .",
            "But the premium chickens were not organic .",
            "In the article , Avery took the Food and Drug Administration to task for failing `` to issue any warnings to consumers about the higher levels of natural toxins their researchers regularly find in organic foods . ''",
            "In the interview , he said that that assertion was based on a statement by Dr. Robert Lake , an official in the agency 's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition .",
            "Lake denied making such a statement , saying , `` We do n't go out of our way to sample organic food , and hence I do n't think we are in a position to say anything one way or another about it . ''",
            "Avery wrote that because `` organic farmers use animal manure as the major source of fertilizer , '' there are higher levels of harmful bacteria in organic food .",
            "Katherine DiMatteo , the executive director of the Organic Trade Association , said that manure is not the major source of fertilizer on organic farms ( it is also used in conventional farming ) and that , when it is used , certain rules must be followed for safety .",
            "Avery said he had never `` bothered that much about consumer safety aspects of organic food until O157 : H7 . ''",
            "His real goal , he said , is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm .",
            "`` My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed ourselves organically , '' he said .",
            "The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that , even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country , the conventional food industry is worried ."

            "The new rules indicate an about-face in the department 's attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for decades .",

            "After initially ignoring many of the recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board , which had been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations , the Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board 's advice , including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as organic ; the use of 100 percent organic feed ; and the requirement of outdoor access for animals .",
            "Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a year .",
            "When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in 1990 , sales of organic food had reached $ 1 billion : projected sales for 1999 are $ 6.46 billion .",
            "Under the new rules , raw products could carry the federal agency 's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100 percent organic , meaning that they are grown and manufactured without the use of added hormones , pesticides or synthetic fertilizer .",
            "Processed food that is made from at least 95 percent organic ingredients could also carry the seal .",

            "The growth of organic food from a fringe movement to a $ 5 billion nationwide industry is based mostly on trust .",
            "When a label says `` grown and processed in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990 , '' it does not necessarily mean the food is truly organic , according to the organic foods industry , farmers , inspectors and others .",
            "Unless the food also has been independently certified , they say , it 's likely no one has checked to ensure the food meets minimum state standards .",
