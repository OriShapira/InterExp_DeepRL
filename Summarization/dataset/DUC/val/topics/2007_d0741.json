            "As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead , including Barton , even his mother said she could n't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history .",
            "`` Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son , Mark , I loved him very much , '' Barton 's 76-year-old mother , Gladys , said in a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter , S.C. `` I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have been prevented . ''",

            "After graduating from Sumter High School in 1973 , Barton attended Clemson University but dropped out .",
            "Two years later , he enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia , where he received his bachelor 's degree in chemistry and met the woman who would become his first wife , Debra Spivey .",

            "By 1988 , he had been named TLC 's president .",

            "In a deposition , Barton said TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to Atlanta to start his own business .",
            "But Texarkana police records also show that , after being fired from TLC , Barton was arrested Sept. 25 , 1990 , and briefly jailed on charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled with information from the company .",
            "Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board members declined to prosecute him , Texarkana police spokesman Jeff Heminger said .",
            "After moving back to Georgia , Barton started his own company , a chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc. , in July 1990 .",
            "But the company was more `` like having a paper route , '' he testified , because it never generated more than a few thousand dollars of business a year .",

            "By that spring , she and Barton were having an affair .",

            "`` We flirted with each other on the phone , '' Barton said , adding that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon .",

            "During this call , Barton testified , she told him she planned to leave her husband .",

            "He was told not to wash his car , but drove it through a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly spilling a Sprite , Smith said .",
            "Investigators said they found blood in Barton 's car , garage and home .",
            "Barton 's defense lawyer , Michael Hauptman , said in an interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who confessed to the killing .",
            "This person is now serving an unrelated prison sentence in Indiana , Hauptman said .",
            "But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had spent the night of the murders with friends .",
            "During his deposition , Barton said the last time he saw Debra alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother 's red Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend .",
            "It was the first time he 'd kept the children overnight by himself , he testified .",
            "That night , with the children worn out and tired , Barton said he sang them songs , read them stories and then put them to bed .",
            "He played on the computer , listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter album and finished off a six-pack , falling asleep on the sofa , awoke during the night and headed to bed .",
            "ADDITONAL TRIM In the weeks before Debra Barton 's killing , her husband had taken out twin life insurance policies _ $ 600,000 for him , $ 600,000 for her .",

            "ATLANTA _ After bludgeoning his wife and two children to death with a hammer , and just eight hours before slaughtering nine people in the brokerage houses where he traded , Mark O. Barton typed a chilling confession on his computer and warned that he planned to live just long enough to kill `` the people that greedily sought my destruction . ''",
            "The letter , which Barton apparently wrote near sunrise Thursday and then left in the Stockbridge , Ga. , apartment where he had killed his family , suggested that he was tortured by his estrangement from his wife , by financial troubles and by unexplained fears that he said had been `` transferred from my father to me and from me to my son . ''",
            "Police in Henry County , Ga. , which includes the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge , released the letter Friday as the authorities searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday 's killing spree , the deadliest in the state 's history .",

            "And perhaps , authorities say , he had expressed the rage before .",
            "He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother .",
            "The next year , he was under investigation for possible molestation of his then 3-year-old daughter .",
