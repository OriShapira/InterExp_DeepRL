            "Those are considered marginal conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules : piloting a plane by using visual or ground references to guide you .",
            "If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet , pilots are required to use Instrument Flight Rules , using a plane 's mechanical systems to guide the flight .",

Bard , a private pilot , who left Martha 's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to his home in Danbury , Conn. `` If you 're not instrument rated , it could be difficult maintaining the airplane in an upright condition , '' he said .",

            "Public records show that he was still a flight student in December 1997 .",
            "He apparently did not have an instrument rating , meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that required reliance on instrument navigation , but the weather on Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating .",
            "The flight may have been challenging , though , authorities said , because on the most direct route , the distance to shore far exceeds the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine failed .",
            "Kennedy had registered the plane , a Piper Saratoga , in April .",
            "A pilot who flies from the same airfield , Essex Airport in Fairfield , N.J. , said that he and Kennedy used the same flight instructor , and that Kennedy frequently flew with the instructor to Martha 's Vineyard on Friday nights , and returned on Sunday nights or Monday mornings .",
            "The instructor , the pilot said , was not aboard the Saratoga on Friday night ; he was in Europe .",

            "Kennedy 's Saratoga was almost new , the pilot said .",

            "Kennedy 's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into the ocean , Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have given it the macabre name `` graveyard spiral . ''",

            "To escape such a catastrophic dive , Wolk added , a pilot must try to level the wings , reduce speed , and lift the nose back above the horizon .",
            "But Kennedy , who had already started his descent toward Martha 's Vineyard , had less than 30 seconds , according to Wolk 's calculations of radar records of the doomed flight , to do all this before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep dive .",
            "His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per minute when it crashed , Wolk said .",
            "`` It 's almost like landing on pavement at that point , '' said Len Carroll , operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood , Mass .. Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy , his wife , and sister-in law might take some time , Carroll said .",

            "From above the water 's surface , it is hard to see objects that have sunk below 10 feet .",
            "Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could take months and that the cause of the crash might never be determined .",
            "But that did n't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what could have gone wrong .",
            "Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy 's relative inexperience in the cockpit , the difficult visibility on a hazy , moonless night and Kennedy 's recent upgrade to a more powerful plane than the one he 'd used for flight training .",
            "But Wolk believes the facts , so far , suggest that airplane malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot error .",
            "A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight could indicate , Wolk said , one of several mechanical errors : a malfunction of the autopilot , the `` artificial horizon '' that feeds information to the autopilot , or the vacuum pumps that drive the plane 's gyroscopic information .",
            "`` All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction of various components , '' Wolk said .",

            "No one has seen it since .",
            "Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine , the series of decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan , choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions , and piloting an airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah , Mass .",
            "The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid descent at 9:38 p.m. Friday , about an hour into his flight and about 17 miles away from Martha 's Vineyard airport .",
            "Sunday , searchers recovered bits of the aircraft 's fuselage and interior ; on Saturday , they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas luggage with one of Lauren Bissette 's business cards attached .",
            "While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the plane 's equipment , officials hope he was familiar with at least one : the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997 .",
            "`` It was an easy on-off switch , '' said Munir Hussein , its second owner , who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for $ 300,000 .",
            "`` I used it several times and it worked perfectly . ''",
            "Investigators say the recorder , which captures the words of a pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit , can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off Aquinnah , known as Gay Head .",
            "The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy 's plane disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is recovered .",
            "But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the very end , according to the review of radar tapes from at least a half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the south coast of New England .",

            "But family friends told the Globe they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did .",
            "After takeoff , Kennedy cruised eastward , flying at 5,500 feet , a standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules , procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see .",
            "As he flew through gathering darkness , only a few stars emerged through the haze , and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky .",
            "Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy 's flight experience _ fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane lifted off .",
            "They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga by instruments alone , but that he was n't yet qualified to do it on a solo flight .",
            "In fact , Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday that for the time being , he 'd rather fly with a copilot because his broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling the plane 's rudder .",
            "Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the plane .",

            "Kennedy 's instructor there told investigators that he had completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until lesson 11 , which is designed to develop a student 's familiarity with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from air-traffic controllers .",

            "Still , investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call , or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the flight .",

            "`` If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late , we will begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls , '' he said .",
            "The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports in the area , the FAA , and , eventually , the Air Force 's Air Rescue Coordination Center in Virginia , Mackie said .",
            "As it turned out , a search was not initiated until after a Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about 2:15 a.m. Saturday .",
