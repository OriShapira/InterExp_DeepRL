                "She plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when attorneys for Bisek , 33 , will try to persuade a judge to toss out Marianne Gingrich 's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn over documents related to her relationship to Newt Gingrich , 56 .",
                "In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court , Gingrich asked a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their divorce is final .",
                "On Thursday , accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in the former U.S. House speaker 's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years , Marianne Gingrich .",
                "In one of the more significant developments of the day , a Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich , 48 , a step closer to questioning Callista Bisek , 33 , under oath about Bisek 's relationship with Newt Gingrich , 56 .",
                "Gingrich filed for divorce July 19 , 1999 , six months after resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years , and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House Republicans to their first majority in 40 years .",
                "ATLANTA , Ga. ( AP ) -- Newt Gingrich has asked a judge to settle his divorce by relying on a financial agreement he and his wife worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former House Speaker came back to an empty home .",
                "The agreement was reached prior to a Thursday hearing that was expected to attract national media , especially after the disclosure of Gingrich 's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide , Callista Bisek of Virginia .",
                "Months earlier , Gingrich had called his wife at her childhood home in Ohio to say he wanted out of the marriage and that he was having an affair with Bisek .",
                "In pleadings released in Cobb County Superior Court , Gingrich , 56 , is demanding that Marianne Gingrich sit for a videotaped deposition on Oct. 19 _ just as she has demanded a videotaped interrogation of Callista Bisek , a House Agriculture Committee aide ."
