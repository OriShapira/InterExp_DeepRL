                "WASHINGTON _ Flanked by Republican lawmakers , the father of Matthew Shepard , a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual , urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians .",
                "Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct. 6 , 1998 , from the Fireside Lounge , where McKinney and Henderson encountered Shepard , to the beatings , which began as the two drove Shepard around town and continued at the fence .",
                "Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie , Wyo. , last year , more than 450 bills have been introduced in legislatures around the country this year on issues important to gays and lesbians .",
                "_ In a case that galvanized national outrage over anti-homosexual violence , a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences .",
                "In that interview , Debree recalled , McKinney said he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay .",
                "( AP ) -- Gay college student Matthew Shepard was pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken , drug-induced rage after Shepard made a pass at him , McKinney 's attorney said Monday as his trial began .",
                "What remains as certain now as on Oct. 12 , the day Matthew died , is that this murder happened against the backdrop of a campaign in which the far right , abetted by political leaders like Trent Lott , was demonizing gay people as sick and sinful .",
                "But in mounting a defense designed to bring a prison term , rather than execution , Tangeman argued that McKinney 's past , as well as his poor judgment , led him to drug addiction and alcohol abuse .",
                "The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual orientation , sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already covered under a 1968 federal law ."
