                "FUZHOU , January 5 ( Xinhua ) -- A school in the western part of east China 's Fujian Province has been set up to provide more qualified professionals , and sports , arts , and music teachers for primary and middle schools in rural areas .",
                "In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years , Harvard researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music improves spatial thinking , but little proof that music and art classes help students read better or score higher on tests .",
                "What 's right is that an increasing number of educators are using technology to interest children in the arts , just as their colleagues continue to strive to use computers to teach the basics of reading , writing and 'rithmetic .",
                "Inner City Arts , founded in 1989 , provides visual and performing arts classes and English language instruction to students from public elementary schools _ largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing industries .",
                "While many public schools , struggling under budget constraints and competing academic interests , are marginalizing arts programs , if not eliminating them altogether , the opposite is happening in the small village of Greenport at the tip of the North Fork on Long Island .",
                "Though no federal law mandates the teaching of fine arts , in 1994 an objective of improving fine-arts instruction was added to the U.S. Department of Education 's Goals for 2000 .",
                "For the last two decades , schools like Public School 156 have increasingly turned to the city 's museums , concert halls and theaters for lessons in art , music and dance .",
                "Their aim was to fill a void in arts education created by Proposition 13 , a property tax cut initiative approved 20 years ago this month by California voters that slashed financing for public services and schools .",
                "Linguistic labs , computer labs , and specialized classrooms for other practical skills will be created in these schools , along with libraries and facilities for music , the arts , and physical education ."
