                "One study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese -- defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight -- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year .",
                "Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight , a rate much higher than Asian or European nations , says Melanie Polk , a registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer Research , a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link between diet and cancer .",
                "Overall , the population of obese men and women in the United States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year , according to the CDC survey , which said that figure might be conservative .",
                "Growth in the marketing of fast food and snack food , as well as lack of exercise , are among the reasons Americans are taking in more calories than they burn , the editorial concluded .",

                "Norton said her $ 15 million Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise ( LIFE ) Act , introduced in Congress late last year , is designed to address the 300,000 cases of preventable disease estimated to result each year from unhealthy diets and physical inactivity .",
                "The lowest obesity rates in the nation , by comparison , were in New England and in the West , where people are more active and the weather is cooler .",
                "In the Southeast , the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that time frame , with Georgia leading the nation with a whopping increase of 101.8 percent .",
                "Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed , the average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002 ."
