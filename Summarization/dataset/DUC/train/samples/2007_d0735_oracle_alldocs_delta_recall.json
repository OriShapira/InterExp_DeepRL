                "Department officials said they believed it was time to remove about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota , Michigan and Wisconsin from the list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act , turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves .",
                "The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to increase their numbers , remove them from the list of species in danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are kept in check .",
                "Ron Refsnider , a wolf biologist for the wildlife agency based in Minnesota and the main author of the classification proposal , said there was still plenty of work to do to nurture the wolves living in the northern Rockies and especially in the Southwest .",
                "Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana , Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful since 1995 , federal officials say , that the first steps toward a single , integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now been taken .",
                "The new policy will not affect the protection of wolves that were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho , reproducing successfully , even though these populations might be reclassified from endangered to threatened .",
                "Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona , New Mexico and northern Mexico but were shot , poisoned and trapped to near extinction by the 1970s .",
                "Both Marks and Cowen said it is doubtful ranchers are the killers because they not only would risk fines under the Endangered Species Act of $ 100,000 and a year in prison , but they also would risk losing their right to graze livestock on public lands .",
                "More than 30 packs totaling 400 to 500 wolves now inhabit large areas of Wyoming , Montana and Idaho , mostly because wolves artificially introduced from western Canada in 1995 and 1996 have rapidly reproduced .",
                "The program to restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey ."
