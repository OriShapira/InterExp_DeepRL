            "_ Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in `` a five-minute emotional rage '' because the student , Matthew Shepard , had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child , McKinney 's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here .",
            "The jury of 12 and four alternates heard a different rationale for the killing from Cal Rerucha , the prosecutor for Albany County , who said that McKinney and a friend , Russell Henderson , fully intended to murder Shepard after kidnapping him and robbing him of $ 20 .",
            "For that , prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for McKinney .",
            "Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death penalty .",
            "He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no chance of parole .",
            "The case attracted wide attention .",
            "Shepard , 21 , was beaten more than 20 times on the head with a .357-magnum handgun , tied to a fence on an isolated prairie road and left to die .",
            "He was found by a bicyclist 18 hours later and taken to a hospital , where he lived only four more days .",
            "The case became a rallying cry for states and the federal government to pass and expand hate-crime measures , but fewer than half the states have passed such measures , and Wyoming remains one of eight states with no hate-crime laws .",
            "Federal lawmakers last week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim 's sexual orientation .",
            "Nor has the case appeared to stir much interest in Laramie .",
            "The spacious courtroom was far from filled .",
            "Shepard 's mother , Judy , sat with several friends opposite several of McKinney 's relatives , including his father , Bill McKinney .",
            "Otherwise , the audience was made up of mostly reporters .",
            "In his opening arguments , Jason Tangeman , one of Kinney 's court-appointed lawyers , conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard 's death .",
            "But in mounting a defense designed to bring a prison term , rather than execution , Tangeman argued that McKinney 's past , as well as his poor judgment , led him to drug addiction and alcohol abuse .",
            "Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at a local bar .",
            "But in disputing Rerucha 's contention that Shepard 's sexual orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence , Tangeman argued that McKinney was `` haunted by a past , that put him into a rage , put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos . ''",
            "The distinction is important .",
            "If prosecutors can prove malicious intent and premeditation , they have a better chance of winning a death sentence .",
            "If defense lawyers can show the killing evolved from a moment of passion or rage , they may persuade the jury to find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge , like manslaughter .",
            "But even if prosecutors put on an air-tight case , it might be difficult to win a death sentence .",
            "Wyoming is one of 38 states that have a death penalty but one of the least inclined to use it .",
            "Since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital punishment was constitutional , Wyoming , Idaho , Colorado and Ohio each have put to death only one prisoner .",
            "Wyoming has only two inmates on death row .",
            "Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct. 6 , 1998 , from the Fireside Lounge , where McKinney and Henderson encountered Shepard , to the beatings , which began as the two drove Shepard around town and continued at the fence .",
            "But in Tangeman 's version , Shepard was portrayed as a sexual predator who had sought a ride from the two men and had `` reached over and grabbed Aaron 's genitals and licked his ear . ''",
            "As a result , Tangeman told the jury , McKinney `` becomes very , very upset and beats Matthew Shepard , '' prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7 .",
            "Tangeman said the older boy threatened to spread the word that McKinney was a homosexual .",
            "Also , Tangeman said , McKinney at 15 had a consensual sexual encounter with a male cousin ."

            "She began drug therapy , and tests showed she was not infected .",
            "But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation , the play reflects a community still in conflict : Romaine Patterson , a university student , says she was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights , yet a Baptist minister , who goes unnamed in the play , says he hopes that during the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence , he had a moment to reflect on his lifestyle .",

            "In an interview , he said the Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie , including those of friends of his who no longer use the word `` fag '' to describe a gay man .",
            "At the same time , he recalled two customers coming into the Fireside last week , asking to buy T-shirts bearing the name of the bar as a souvenir of where Shepard spent his last moments .",
            "Galloway said he was repulsed by the request .",
            "Zackie Salmon , 52 , who manages a scholarship program at the university , was briefly portrayed onstage , expressing repugnance at one of the killers , Aaron J. McKinney .",

            "Dressed soberly in black pants , a gray shirt , and a black and white paisely tie , Henderson had let his hair grow out , shunning the skinhead look he favored at the time of his arrest .",
            "`` It was 10 p.m. , and me and Aaron decided to go out to a bar , '' Henderson testified , responding to question 's by his lawyer , Wyatt Skaggs .",
            "After drinking `` a few pitchers of beer '' at the first bar , he said they went to a second bar , the Fireside .",
            "There , while drinking another pitcher , he said McKinney noticed the college student .",
            "`` Aaron had mentioned to me that he wanted to take him out and rob him , '' Henderson testified in a clear if subdued voice .",
            "`` I disagreed with this . ''",
            "Painting his former roofing workmate as the author of the crime , he said that McKinney told tim to drive the pickup truck borrowed from McKinney 's father , where to drive and where to park .",
            "`` Aaron McKinney , he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard to give him his wallet , '' continued Henderson , who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard .",
            "After parking in an isolated field near a subdivision where Henderson once lived , McKinney `` pulled Matthew out of the truck and continued to hit him , '' with the pistol , he said .",
            "`` Aaron told me to go get a rope out of the truck , '' Henderson continued as the Shepards stared grimly ahead .",
            "`` Aaron told me to tie his hands '' to a fence pole .",
            "`` Matthew looked really bad , I told him to stop , '' Henderson continued .",
            "`` Mr. McKinney hit me above the mouth .",
            "I returned to the pickup truck . ''",
            "After driving away , leaving the beating victim tied to a fence in temperatures that dropped below freezing , Henderson said that he and his friend got into another fight .",
            "When caught by a Laramie police man , he said that he lied about what he had been doing earlier that evening .",
            "The next day , instead of calling for medical help for Shepard , Henderson said that he and his girl friend , Chasity Pasley , and McKinney 's girlfriend , Kristen LeAnn Price , drove 50 miles east to a truck stop in Cheyenne with his bloody clothing `` and put it in a dumpster to cover up that I was out there when Matthew was beaten . ''",
            "Ms. Pasley pled guilty in December to being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder and faces sentencing .",
            "Ms. Price was freed on bond in January and faces a trial on the same charges in May .",
            "nn After Henderson spoke , it was the turn of Lucy Thompson , his maternal grandmother who has raised him since he was a baby .",
            "`` Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering that the Shepards have gone through , '' Mrs. Thompson , said turning to Matthew 's parents who sat in the front row of the courtroom .",
            "A devout Mormon , she said , `` We have prayed for you many , many times .",
            "You have showed us such mercy . ''",
            "Mrs. Thompson , who raised Henderson until he dropped out of Laramie High School near the end of his senior year , described him as `` a survivor '' whose `` mother was young and not ready to be a mother . ''",
            "Three months ago , at age 40 , Cindy Thompson Dixon , Russell 's mother , froze to death on a rural road outside of Laramie after a night of drinking .",
            "Describing a `` loving and kind '' side to her grandson , she recalled him playing on the floor with his young cousins .",
            "As his aunts and other relatives hugged each other for comfort on a front-row bench , she added , `` Even as a teenager , Russell was never embarrassed to give me a hug or to kiss me on the forehead in front of his peers . ''",
            "Referring to newspaper accounts of his grandson 's expressionless demeanor in court , she said , `` I have looked into his eyes , and I know '' that he is in pain .",
            "Noting that `` the case has developed into a hate crime , '' she said that she never preached hatred in her household and that `` Russell has never been a hateful individual . ''",
            "Russell , she intimated , was a loyal follower , adding , `` Sometimes friends would take advantage of his loyalties . ''",
            "In closing , she turned to the judge and begged him not `` to take Russell out of our lives forever . ''",
            "Turning to Matthew 's parents again , she looked them in the eyes and said , `` I want to thank all the Shepards .",
            "I love you even though I have never known you . ''",
            "The packed courtroom had scarcely absorbed this appeal , when it was the turn of Henderson , who hoped to earn a slim chance of one day winning parole .",
            "Standing at the same podium , he turned his back to the judge and addressed Matthew 's family , saying , `` Mr. and Mrs. Shepard , there is not a day that does n't go by that I do n't see what happened that night . ''",
            "`` I know what I did , '' he continued , turning back to Donnell .",
            "`` I 'm very sorry for what I did .",
            "I am ready to pay for what I did . ''",
            "Then it was the turn of Mr. and Mrs. Shepard , who had traveled from their home in Saudi Arabia for the chance to address the court in their native Wyoming .",
            "Mrs. Shepard spoke first , pausing at times to regain her composure as she recalled her son 's blossoming interest in theater , politics and international cultures .",
            "`` He was n't my son , my first born anymore , '' she said , recalling hugs and late night talks .",
            "`` He was my friend , my confidante , my constant reminder of how good life can be . ''",
            "She remembered that the last time she saw him he was covered with bandages and wired with tubes in an intensive care unit of a Fort Collins , Colo. , hospital .",
            "`` One of his eyes was partially open , '' she recalled .",
            "`` I could see the clear blue of his eye .",
            "But the twinkle of his life was n't there any more . ''",
            "In contrast to the warm and trusting son she had known , she said that touching his arm in the hospital provoked an involuntary reaction , `` He began to shake and quiver . ''",
            "Referring to her son 's savage beating _ he was kicked in the groin and beaten 18 times around the head _ she said in disbelief that `` such an act of cruelty was unthinkable . ''",
            "The stress on the Shepard family was so great , she continued , that within a month of Matthew 's funeral , his paternal grandfather died .",
            "`` At times , I do n't think you are worthy of addressing , '' Mrs. Shepard said , turning to the man who had just pled guilty to murdering her son .",
            "Speaking slowly , but firmly , she vowed , `` We wo n't allow you to kill our family . ''",
            "Shepard , looking drawn , rose to speak , saying he had thrown away remarks he had written on the plane .",
            "`` My son was born blind , '' he said in an impromptu speech .",
            "`` Not physically blind , but blind to people 's differences _ short or tall ; black , brown or white ; religion or ethnic backgrounds .",
            "His friends included gays and so-called straights . ''",
            "`` When I meet strangers and make small talk , they ask , ` do you have children ? ' ''",
            "he continued .",
            "`` Now , I take a deep breath and say ` I have one son , ' not two . ''",
            "He recalled bathing his young son , teaching him to sing `` Row , Row , Row Your Boat , '' `` Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star '' and other nursery rhymes .",
            "With anger in his voice , he turned to the defendant and said , `` You , Mr. Henderson , helped to sink that boat , to shoot Frere Jacques , and to shoot down that star . ''",
            "Summing up his remarks to a 175-pound man who had helped to kill his 105-pound son , Matthew 's father said , `` It takes a brave man to tie up another man , who did not know how to clench a fist until he was 13 years old . ''",
            "After the Shepards , Cal Rerucha , the Albany County attorney , kept his remarks brief .",
            "Turning to the defendant , he said , `` Mr. Henderson you have created hell on earth _ for a family , for our community , for the state . ''"

            "But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate last year , this time it has touched off heated debate over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law enforcement .",
            "Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper , Texas , of James Byrd , a 49-year-old black man , who was dragged behind a pickup truck ; and the death , also in 1998 , of Matthew Shepard , a 21-year-old homosexual University of Wyoming student , who died after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence .",
