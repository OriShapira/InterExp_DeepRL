            "Customers who enjoy the convenience of the Web might also prefer knowing that if anything goes wrong with a purchase , they can find a real person at a real store to make it better .",
            "`` The need for this is huge , '' said Tim Washer , director of interactive research with NFO Interactive , a market research company .",

            "The boxes will initially be used for rental videos , games and DVDs , but will eventually be available for other products , as well , like disposable cameras ready for processing or defective items being returned for a refund .",
            "In addition , Starbucks will promote Kozmo and train its sales staff to answer questions about the Internet company .",
            "Kozmo , in turn , will deliver Starbucks coffees and teas by the pound _ and eventually perhaps hot beverages , too .",

            "Vroom said Internet retailers typically spent about $ 100 to acquire each customer _ an exorbitant amount , because the average customer will spend only about $ 200 at a given site in a lifetime .",
            "A $ 30 million annual outlay to Starbucks will swell Kozmo 's customer acquisition costs in the short term , he said , but in the long term it could pay off , given Starbucks ' huge clientele .",
            "`` Starbucks can put a Kozmo logo on coffee cups that 10 million customers a week will buy , '' Vroom said .",

            "Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods _ not simply rental items , but , more important , goods deemed unsatisfactory by the customers .",
            "Internet merchants have been widely criticized for their failures in this regard , particularly as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent _ a rate slightly higher than in the catalog industry .",
            "nn Retailers with stores online and offline , like Gap and Federated 's Macy 's , have had an edge at least in part because their customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought online or off .",
            "And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up stores for this reason alone , they are clearly in the market for help from companies that can help streamline returns .",
            "`` As I speak , there are four or five people from e-commerce companies in this building talking to us about it , '' said James Amos , chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc. , speaking from his office in San Diego .",

            "`` We 're in discussions with just about everyone that 'd come to the top of your mind , '' he said .",
            "Amos said the deluge began late last year when the company agreed to provide customers of eBay auctions with help in inspecting and returning items bought online .",
            "Since then , Mail Boxes has begun installing satellite dishes in franchise stores , in hopes of connecting all of its business partners in a single network .",
            "The satellites will not only provide high-speed Internet access , the company said , but will link the stores ' cash registers directly to the corporate office and to the company 's e-commerce partners .",
            "That setup , in turn , will allow the company to plug into the back-office systems of Internet retailers _ so that if a customer of an Internet-only merchant wanted to exchange an item at a Mail Boxes store , the replacement item could be sent to a Mail Boxes location .",
            "The customer could then simply drop off the old item , pick up the new one and not have to deal with packaging , postage or coordinating delivery times .",
            "Noting that the first e-commerce partnerships will be announced after the satellite system is completed next month , Amos said , `` We 're basically going to be a bridge between the virtual and the real world . ''",
            "Naturally , Mail Boxes will have plenty of company in that regard .",
            "United Parcel Service , which recently announced plans to expand its network of drop-off centers by testing storefront locations in suburban areas , might use those stores to support e-commerce companies .",

            "`` I do n't think someone will pick up their living room furniture at our store . ''",

            "Besides getting cash , customers would be able to cash checks or obtain money orders or get directions from Web sites , for instance .",
