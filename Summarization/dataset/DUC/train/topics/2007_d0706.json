            "In the decade since they seized power and renamed the country Myanmar , Burma 's military rulers have become increasingly dependent on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power , build the country 's infrastructure , and carry out its war against stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities .",

            "But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have received little attention , in part because the rapes have been perpetrated in inaccessible areas .",

''",
            "The court , which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be held liable for rapes committed by their military partner , will hear the case next year ; the junta was dropped as a defendent because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign government .",
            "The UN Commission on Human Rights says women most likely to be raped are refugees , internally displaced women , and women belonging to ethnic minorities or the political opposition .",

            "Marked `` top secret '' and dated only a few weeks after the military takeover in 1988 , the document is addressed to `` All Great Ruling Burmans '' and outlines a policy of `` blood mixing '' and `` Burmanization '' of ethnic minorities -- a reference to the process by which Burmans , who now represent two-thirds of Burma 's population , could become more dominant .",
