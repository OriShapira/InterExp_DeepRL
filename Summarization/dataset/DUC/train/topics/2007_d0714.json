            "WASHINGTON _ The Senate indicated Tuesday that it wants no part of the hottest controversy in the music business , ensuring that the youth-driven trend to download music from the Internet will continue to reshape the industry , at least for now .",
            "After listening to Metallica rocker Lars Ulrich square off with the Byrds folksinger Roger McGuinn over the evils and joys of Internet music downloads , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , said , `` I think the courts can handle it . ''",
            "Hatch said the Senate will keep `` a close eye '' on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors , such as San Mateo-based Napster , but will take no action now .",
            "The committee 's ranking Democrat , Patrick Leahy of Vermont agreed , adding that movie studios were once `` terrified '' of videotapes , which later turned into a major revenue stream for Hollywood .",
            "`` In the end , things get sorted out and new ( technologies ) offer new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers , '' Leahy said .",
            "`` Let 's not strangle the baby in the cradle . ''",
            "The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry , recording companies , Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of `` intellectual property '' across the spectrum of copyrighted material .",
            "Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft , saying it robs artists of their livelihoods , strangles artistic creation and , ultimately , will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up .",
            "Internet distributors contend that established industries are trying to stifle a hugely & LR ; popular technology that will bring untold convenience and flexibility to consumers .",
            "They say they want to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as competitors .",
            "The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco companies , and that the suits could put them out of business .",
            "In any event , some argued Tuesday that technologies such as Napster and a more sophisticated program called `` Gnutella '' _ a free software that allows users to download music from each other 's computers rather than a central server _ are inherently uncontrollable .",
            "Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove 's prediction that `` the whole Internet could be rearchitected by Napster-like technology . ''",

            "Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a song for the movie `` Mission Impossible-2 '' when members heard that radio stations were already playing versions of the work in progress .",
            "The band traced the `` leaks '' to Napster and filed a lawsuit .",
            "`` My band authored the music which is Napster 's lifeblood , '' Ulrich said .",
            "`` We should decide what happens to it , not Napster _ a company with no rights in our recordings , which never invested a penny in Metallica 's music or had anything to do with its creation . ''",
            "Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site 's 20 million users have a right to `` share '' music under copyright law .",
            "Barry argued that Internet distribution `` is helping , not hurting '' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it , leading to more store sales .",
            "And he said Internet distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to each other .",
            "The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed , charging that recording studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them .",
            "Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits as `` Mr. Tambourine Man '' and `` Turn , Turn , Turn , '' McGuinn said he `` never saw any royalties '' from most of his work other than meager advances .",
            "`` The recording companies have ways of not paying , '' he said .",
            "In 1994 , McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com , which paid him `` an unheard of '' 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned .",
            "But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein , who took a much harder line than her colleagues on copyright infringement .",
            "`` To my way of thinking , Napster has found a method which entirely defeats copyright protection , '' Feinstein said .",
            "Barry sharply countered , `` Sales are up , Senator , '' but Feinstein was undeterred .",
            "`` You could do the same thing with a book , '' she said .",
            "`` You could do the same thing with a movie .",
            "You are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with your technology , all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the other end of a server . ''",
            "Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every technological advance , `` from the piano roll to radio to cassettes to VCRs .",
            "These horrible prophecies have not come true .",
            "In every case it 's been a financial boon '' to copyright holders and content producers .",
            "Hilary Rosen , president of the Recording Industry Association of America , drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella , which pay no royalties , and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City , which do .",
            "But Gene Kan , a University of California at Berkeley graduate in electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella , said the `` toothpaste is already out of the tube '' and that Napster 's 20 million users of today `` will be 100 million tomorrow . ''",
            "Attempts to `` lock up '' copyrighted material will be defeated eventually , Kan predicted .",
            "Gene Hoffman , founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City , agreed that the convenience , flexibility and infinite availability of music on the Internet will upend the music industry 's reliance on physical distribution .",
            "But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents for a single track and $ 8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists and can not compete with free music .",
            "`` The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster will invalidate the concept of paying for music , '' Hoffman said .",
            "Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now , he warned that Washington will `` be watching very closely '' to see that `` fair and reasonable licensing '' takes place between recording studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are compensated _ and that Web sites get access to recordings ."

            "In granting the industry 's request for a preliminary injunction , Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S. District Court in San Francisco ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used primarily to trade copyrighted material , a behavior that Patel said Napster knew about .",
            "`` A majority of Napster users use the service to download and upload copyrighted music , '' the judge said .",
            "The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday and will continue pending trial .",
            "The case has become the rallying point for competing interests in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet , with lawyers , consumers , policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely .",
            "And legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond music , to the sharing of other media like movies , and may set a tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet .",
            "David Boies , the lead lawyer for Napster , said the company would immediately appeal .",
            "He said that Napster did not have the ability to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not .",
            "This injunction `` does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate , '' Boies said .",

            "The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own .",

            "Moreover , she said the users reaped economic advantage from making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they might ordinarily pay for .",
            "In seeking the preliminary injunction , lawyers for the recording industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within six months .",
            "The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded 14,000 songs a minute .",
            "`` This is the most egregious case of massive copyright infringement that has ever existed , '' Russell Frackman , a record label lawyer , told the judge .",
            "Boies , who represented the government in its antitrust case against Microsoft , said that an injunction should not be granted because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster 's uses that do not infringe on copyrights , like sharing works that do not have copyrights .",
            "Boies cited the U.S. Supreme Court 's 1984 decision that Sony was not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax videocassette recorder , in part because the device was `` capable of substantial noninfringing uses . ''",
            "But Patel did not accept the argument .",
            "`` While Napster may be capable of some other things , they seem to pale in comparison to what Napster was created for , '' she said .",
            "The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster 's impact , or lack thereof , on music sales .",
            "One study , commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
