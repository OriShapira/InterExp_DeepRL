            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr came under increased criticism Wednesday as a Democratic senator questioned his conduct of the Monica Lewinsky investigation .",
            "The Justice Department also has advised Starr it intends to investigate the actions of Starr 's office , including the Jan. 16 , 1998 offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her not discussing it with her lawyer , Frank Carter .",
            "Another possible area of inquiry : Starr 's failure to inform the department that he and others on his staff had contact with lawyers working on Paula Jones ' sexual harassment suit against President Clinton .",
            "Democrats have suggested a possible conflict and misrepresentation when Starr 's prosecutors told the Justice Department they had n't had any contact with Mrs. Jones ' lawyers .",
            "Those comments by Starr 's prosecutors are memorialized in notes taken by participants at a meeting in January 1998 at the Justice Department , when Attorney General Janet Reno was trying to decide whether Starr 's office should handle the Lewinsky investigation .",
            "`` We 've heard a lot about the rule of law recently '' in the impeachment trial , said Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin .",
            "`` How does '' the rule of law `` apply to Ken Starr and the Office of Independent Counsel ?",
            "Honesty and truthfulness and the rule of law also applies to those who are cloaked with the authority and the responsibility of enforcing those laws . ''",
            "One area that may be of concern to the Justice Department is the contact between Paul Rosenzweig , who is a member of Starr 's office , and Philadelphia lawyer Jerome Marcus , who assisted Mrs. Jones ' legal team .",
            "Four days before Linda Tripp 's first contact with Starr 's office on Jan. 12 , 1998 , Marcus spoke with Rosenzweig about the Lewinsky allegations , a contact that Starr confirmed in his testimony Nov. 19 to the House Judiciary Committee .",
            "Starr said his office did not act on it that he did not believe the information on Jan. 8 , 1998 included any mention of Linda Tripp 's name .",
            "In addition , The New York Times has reported that there were several conversations between Marcus and Rosenzweig from November 1997 to January 1998 .",
            "There also are questions about the contact between Starr law partner Richard Porter and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg .",
            "When Mrs. Tripp was looking for a new attorney , Goldberg called Porter on Mrs. Tripp 's behalf .",
            "The question is whether , through his contact with Goldberg , Porter ended up representing anyone , including Mrs. Tripp , involved in the case who went to the prosecutor 's office .",
            "Depending on precisely what Porter did , Starr could have been barred from taking on the Lewinsky probe because of a conflict-of-interest provision in the law governing appointment of independent counsels ."

            "She was also a lot easier to ignore , because her self-imposed silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a response .",
            "But all that changed on Wednesday , when Tripp emerged from her final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing herself off as a victim .",
            "`` I never , ever asked to be placed in this position , '' Tripp declared .",

            "It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton .",
            "It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes .",
            "It was Tripp who reportedly baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to lawyers in Paula Jones ' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton .",

            "The average American is not a scheming , back-stabbing , double-dealing creep who would rather indulge some perverse hatred for a politician than help a friend who 's clearly in need of help .",
            "Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian spinmeisters , show-business jokemasters and `` legions of paid prevaricators . ''",
            "She obviously does n't think she asked for all that , either .",
            "But she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young woman who trusted her .",
            "Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target for vilification .",
            "No one who is inventive enough to touch off a scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so .",
            "Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad , depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an average American .",
            "And she is not a victim , though she has victimized others .",
