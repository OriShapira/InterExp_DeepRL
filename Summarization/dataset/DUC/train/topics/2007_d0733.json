            "WASHINGTON -- The world 's biggest library could turn into just a `` museum of books '' unless it gets started this year on long-range plans to collect and secure the rising flood of digital information , a federal advisory panel warned on Wednesday .",
            "If there are any questions about the right of the Library of Congress to collect material from American Web sites , the National Research Council said in a thick report , it should try to get the law changed to make clear that it has the right .",
            "'' ( The Library ) serves no narrow set of interests but the broadest public purposes of a powerful nation , '' the report said .",
            "''It represents the commitment of the governing bodies of that nation to a strategy of preserving the heritage of the past and making it useful for the future . ''",
            "The National Research Council advises the federal government , the public and the country 's scientists and engineers .",
            "A committee prepared the report under the leadership of James J. O'Donnell , chief information officer and vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania .",
            "The library is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year .",
            "It has more than 9 million books , 11 million films and photos and more than 53 million manuscripts .",
            "Each year it puts about 1 million largely historical items -- such as the papers of Presidents Washington and Lincoln -- on its Web site .",
            "''The committee 's purpose ... is to encourage readers of this report to take a deep breath and to look out to the horizon , '' it said .",
            "''With the Library and its friends focused on a common vision , it will be easier to take the steps -- some small , some large -- that need to be taken .",

            "WASHINGTON _ In 1990 , James Billington , the librarian of Congress , persuaded Congress to provide the first $ 1 million to start building a national library without walls .",
            "The idea then was to duplicate much of the Library of Congress ' huge holdings in electronic form so people in other parts of the country could have access to the material without traveling to Washington or even leaving home .",
            "At that time , said Laura Campbell , a Library of Congress official , the only media suitable to the task were the video disk and the CD-ROM .",
            "`` We 're not in the distribution business , '' Ms. Campbell said .",
            "`` How could we get this out ? ''",
            "Of course , Ms. Campbell said , those were `` the days before the Internet . ''",
            "By 1994 , the World Wide Web had evolved , making it easy for even casual computer users to gain access to information on the Internet .",
            "The Library of Congress saw it as the answer and sought contributions to help put its holdings on line .",
            "The library solicited a donation from David Packard , the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard , who knows something of computers .",
            "`` He said he loved the idea of getting this information out , '' Ms. Campbell said .",
            "`` He gave us our first $ 5 million . ''",
            "Metromedia chairman John Kluge gave $ 5 million , and the W.K .",
            "Kellogg Foundation contributed $ 3 million .",
            "The $ 13 million in donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it has reached its goal of raising $ 45 million for the project from the private sector , while Congress has added $ 15 million .",
            "The gateway to the collection , which is stored on a server at the library , is the Library of Congress ' American Memory site ( memory.loc.gov/ammem/amhome.html ) .",
            "It drew 132,000 unique visitors , or people who went to the site at least once , during February , said a spokeswoman for Media Metrix , an Internet measurement company .",
            "By comparison , the Library of Congress ' main government page , Thomas ( thomas.loc.gov ) , which provides access to every part of the federal government , got 249,000 unique visitors that month , according to Media Metrix .",
            "`` Our competitive strength , '' Ms. Campbell said , `` is that we have these unique and rare treasures to offer . ''",
            "A person skimming through the offerings the other day clicked into World War I material .",
            "First there was a recording of George M. Cohan 's `` Over There , '' sung by Billy Murray in 1917 .",
            "Then came a recording from the U.S. commander in France , Gen. John J. Pershing , who recorded a 33-second speech called `` From the Battlefields of France '' in which he said : `` Three thousand miles from home , an American army is fighting for you .",
            "Everything you hold worthwhile is at stake .",
            "Only the hardest blows can win against the enemy we are fighting .",
            "Invoking the spirit of our forefathers , the army asks your unshrinking support , to the end that the high ideals for which America stands may endure upon the earth . ''",
            "From there , it was easy to navigate to a collection of World War I photographs , one of them showing a German zeppelin brought down in an English field .",
            "Ms. Campbell , who is director of the library 's National Digital Library and directs a staff of 100 people , said there were now 1.7 million items on the Web site .",
            "The goal is to have 5 million by next year , the library 's bicentennial .",
            "The eventual target is to make available 80 million items from the Library of Congress ' collection that can not be easily obtained elsewhere .",
            "A complete set of Mark Twain is available at just about every American library , so books like that will not be made available on the Internet .",
            "What will be made available are materials like the earliest movies and sound recordings , maps , manuscripts , the papers of 23 presidents and photographs .",
            "Fragile rare books are also being put online ; less handling means that they will probably last longer .",
            "Theft from libraries is also reduced when users go digital .",
            "One such rare item is Ralph Waldo Emerson 's 1855 letter praising Walt Whitman 's `` Leaves of Grass , '' in which the established Emerson called the little-known Whitman 's work `` the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed , '' according to the site .",
            "Without asking permission , Whitman used Emerson 's testimonial in advertising for later editions of his collection of poetry , including some in which he added erotic elements .",
            "Emerson was not pleased , the entry adds .",
            "With the Library of Congress site , a teacher of a history course on the American Revolution will be able to have students study not only the final Declaration of Independence but also an earlier draft by Thomas Jefferson with corrections in the margin by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams .",
            "The American Memory site has Civil War photographs by Matthew Brady and others ( a picture taken by Alexander Gardner shows Confederate dead at Antietam in 1862 ) , the earliest authenticated daguerreotype portrait of Abraham Lincoln ( taken by Nicholas H. Sheperd in 1846 or 1847 ) , turn-of-the-century films of New York street scenes ( in one a horse-drawn fire engine races around a corner ) and Alexander Graham Bell 's 1876 sketch of the telephone , without which none of this would be possible .",
            "& QL ; nn The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its potential electronic audience from schools , universities and school libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem .",
            "The Library of Congress can get its material in the most unexpected ways .",
            "A collection of early baseball cards , which can be seen on the American Memory site , was gathered by Benjamin K. Edwards , who left it to his daughter , who gave it to the poet Carl Sandburg , who donated it to the library .",
            "The Edwards collection includes 2,100 baseball cards , produced from 1887 to 1914 , and depicts the likes of Ty Cobb , Cy Young , Connie Mack , Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson .",
            "In those days , most of the cards were distributed with cigarettes and were used for both advertising and for stiffening the packages .",
            "To spread the word , the Library of Congress has begun a program to show teachers how to use its collection in their classrooms .",
            "The program , called American Memory Fellows , sends 50 teachers to Washington for a week each summer and trains them .",
            "`` They agree to spend six weeks on line before coming here , '' Ms. Campbell said , `` and then give a commitment to continue to work with us and make primary sources available in the classroom . ''",
            "The teachers who have participated in the program 's first two years , Ms. Campbell said , `` are spreading the word '' about the library on the Internet .",
            "Susan Veccia , project manager for the National Digital Library , said that the fellows for this year had been selected already .",
            "`` If money is available , we will have it in years ahead . ''",
            "Information about applying for the fellowships can be obtained by selecting the Learning Page on the American Memory home page and then clicking on Educators ' Program .",
            "Asked how the fellows were chosen , Ms. Veccia said that the Library of Congress sought teachers `` who come with an idea of how they are going to use it , who have some facility with the technology _ we really ca n't be teaching technology skills at this point _ and who are leaders in their fields . ''",
            "The fellowship pays for transportation to Washington and accommodations while here .",
            "Ms. Veccia said here was not a clear picture of how much of the Internet was being used in the classroom for educational purposes and how much the Internet was simply being used to exchange e-mail messages .",
            "Besides its own collection , the Library of Congress plans to put other institutions ' materials on the American Memory site .",
            "It has received $ 2 million from Ameritech to start doing this with material from the New-York Historical Society ( which has provided its Civil War collection ) and the Chicago Historical Society ( the holder of the archives of The Chicago Daily News , a defunct newspaper with a notable sports collection ) .",
            "For most of its 200 years , the Library of Congress has been notable for its collection of books .",
            "Does this emphasis on electronic media mark a basic shift in emphasis ?",
            "No , answered Robert Zich , the director of the project 's electronic programs , it is really a way to whet the appetite .",

            "WASHINGTON _ A renowned letter by Thomas Jefferson , which is the highlight of a traveling Library of Congress exhibition intended as a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation , has been seized upon by conservative Christian leaders as support for their campaign for classroom prayer , taxpayer-financed vouchers for religious schools and posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms .",
            "Some conservative groups and scholars say the Library 's analysis of Jefferson 's letter is authoritative evidence that could be used in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and government .",
            "At the heart of the exhibition _ and of the controversy _ is a famous letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 .",
            "In it , the nation 's third president coined the phrase `` wall of separation between Church and State . ''",
            "Jefferson 's letter has been used in Supreme Court cases for more than a century to describe the proper relationship between religion and government .",
            "The Library of Congress ' analysis of the Jefferson letter , released at a news conference in May and written by James Hutson , chief of the library 's manuscript division , asserted that Jefferson never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law , but instead was aimed at winning political favor with New England constituents .",
            "Hutson 's analysis said : `` The Danbury Baptist Letter was never conceived by Jefferson to be a statement of fundamental principles ; it was meant to be a political manifesto , nothing more . ''",
            "The conservative leaders said this was proof that Jefferson 's `` wall '' metaphor should never have been interpreted as an overarching principle .",
            "The Christian Coalition immediately issued a news release headlined `` Library of Congress Skewers ` Wall of Separation ' Myth , '' and said the library 's findings should bolster the campaign for the `` religious freedom amendment . ''",
            "The magazine of Focus on the Family , a multimedia ministry , called Jefferson 's wall `` flimsy . ''",
            "Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council wrote that Jefferson 's words had been `` twisted by liberals . ''",
            "And last month the controversy ricocheted from Christian radio to the ivory tower , when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the Jefferson letter was misleading and `` unbalanced . ''",
            "`` We are concerned for really one fundamental reason , '' said Robert Alley , professor emeritus of humanities at the University of Richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the library .",
            "`` If you 're going to be the keeper of the precious documents of the nation , you ought not to put them on display with biased analysis , and certainly not with a paper that has not been read by its peers and judged for its qualities , and with as many egregious observations of opinion . ''",
            "In an interview at the Library of Congress , Hutson , caretaker of the library 's manuscripts for 16 years , said he was amazed that a brief paper he wrote as a `` press primer '' without footnotes had been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications .",
            "`` The last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on constitutional law , '' Hutson said , his face flushing .",
            "( STORY CAN END HERE .",
            "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn Hutson is 61 , a Presbyterian churchgoer , a Yale graduate and an expert on Benjamin Franklin .",
            "He said he was chagrined that the uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he painstakingly collected for the exhibition .",
            "He said he would not repudiate the thesis of his paper , but added , `` Maybe I should have been more careful , but I really did try to guard against anything like this happening . ''",
            "The tempest began when Hutson set out to decipher the blotted-out lines in the first draft of Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association .",
            "The final version says that `` religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & AMP ; his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , & AMP ; not opinions . ''",
            "Jefferson restated the First Amendment 's religion clause , and followed with the words `` thus building a wall of separation between Church and State . ''",
            "Hutson asked the FBI to use its computer laboratory to uncover the inked-out words in Jefferson 's letter , just as the bureau had done with a diary of Theodore Roosevelt 's .",
            "In doing so , Hutson was performing excavation on a document that is a touchstone of American history .",
            "The `` wall of separation '' metaphor , though not found in the Constitution , is often invoked as shorthand for the religion clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution , which says that `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ''",
            "The import of the `` separation '' language has been argued over by scholars and cited in at least 50 Supreme Court cases dealing with the relationship between government and religion .",
            "The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds vs. United States in 1878 that the `` wall '' metaphor was `` almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect '' of the First Amendment .",
            "Since then , justices like Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist have argued that Jefferson 's words were misused .",
            "The FBI discovered that Jefferson had crossed out the word `` eternal '' preceding `` separation of Church and State '' _ as some scholars had correctly guessed years before _ and inked over `` the duties of my station , which are merely temporal . ''",
            "That last word meant secular , as opposed to spiritual .",
            "In his essay , Hutson surmised that Jefferson removed these phrases because they might sound `` too anti-religious to pious New England ears . ''",
            "Jefferson 's letter , dated Jan. 1 , 1802 , was meant to reassure the Baptists of Connecticut , who were suffering persecution from the Congregationalists in control of that state .",
            "Jefferson also wrote that as president , he would not proclaim national feast days and thanksgivings .",
            "But Hutson said that Jefferson omitted that section because his advisers warned that it might offend potential political allies .",
            "Two days after writing the Danbury Baptist letter , Jefferson attended church services held in the House of Representatives , Hutson wrote , which was `` his way of offering symbolic support for religious faith and for its beneficent role in republican government . ''",
            "Conservatives like Randy Tate , executive director of the Christian Coalition , embraced Hutson 's findings , saying , `` Some in the American elite would love to exclude all semblance of religious expression in the public square , and I think that runs counter to what Thomas Jefferson meant . ''",
            "David Barton , president of WallBuilders , a group that says it aims to restore biblical values in public policy , said , `` The library has confirmed what a lot of us have already been saying , that that letter was never meant to be a national policy paper . ''",
            "The backlash followed .",
            "In June , Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , an advocacy group in Washington , asked the library to declare Hutson 's research `` merely one opinion , '' with which Lynn said most scholars disagree .",
            "The letter from the 24 scholars , written by them but faxed to the library by Americans United , lambasted Hutson 's basic contention that Jefferson 's letter was a matter of politics and not principle .",
            "Robert M. O'Neill , director of the Thomas Jefferson Center and a professor of law at the University of Virginia , who helped draft the scholars ' letter , said , `` The fact that there may have been a political context for Jefferson 's letter hardly disqualifies it as an assertion of principle , especially since it is so consistent with everything else he did or said on this issue . ''",
            "The controversy may reverberate in the courts , said Daniel Dreisbach , an associate professor of justice at American University .",
            "`` I 'll bet you my house , '' he said , that some judges , faced with a case on school vouchers or creches on city hall steps , will say , `` We should n't be basing constitutional law on the Danbury letter . ''",
            "The exhibition is now closed in Washington , and will soon travel to Dallas , Philadelphia , Indianapolis and southern California .",
            "The library , whose staff members say they are not accustomed to such controversy , is now trying to calm the furor .",
            "In a letter in response to the 24 scholars , James Billington , the librarian of Congress , said that `` the library has no control whatsoever over the use that is made of , nor of the interpretation given to , the many materials that it presents to the public . ''",

            "King said then that by accepting a payment that is far below the $ 30 million appraised value of the papers , the family was `` meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr. King while making a substantial gift to the nation . ''",
            "Jill Brett , public affairs officer at the Library of Congress , said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain circumstances .",
            "`` The library traditionally makes an effort to retain certain rights when we obtain a collection , but we have allowed reasonable restrictions on a case-by-case basis on donations in the past , '' Brett said .",
            "Reasonable restrictions would include copyright control on literary works of noted authors and historical figures .",
            "But the purchase of the King papers is different , lawmakers say , because the collection would be purchased , not donated .",
            "`` If we are going to purchase or acquire the papers , we ought to have full control over the papers , '' said Rep. John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , a senior member of the House Administration Committee , which has jurisdiction over the Library of Congress .",
            "Behind the scenes , Rep. Jim Clyburn ( D-S.C. ) and Rep. John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) are working to bring legislation to the floor authorizing the Library of Congress to purchase or acquire the papers through private donations .",
            "The Senate passed such a measure , but the authorization is stalled in the House over the copyright issue and over a sense among members that the papers should be donated .",
            "`` I do n't know a president or any national figure who has n't donated their papers , '' said Rep. Johnny Isakson ( R-Ga. ) `` The papers are important , but this is unprecedented . ''",
            "Members of the civil rights movement agree .",
            "`` I think this contradicts directly what Dr. King stood for and believed in : that there are more important things than material wealth , '' said Gilbert Jonas , a chief NAACP fund-raiser for 30 years who donated his own papers to the Library of Congress .",
            "`` The man who stood for the spiritual values of this country is being exploited . ''",
            "Jonas said he can not think of any members of the civil rights movement who sold their papers to the Library of Congress or other institution .",
            "But it is not just the commercialization of the King legacy that has prompted concern .",
            "Historians are equally worried about the collection that will be left behind at the King Center in Atlanta .",
            "Louise Cook , former director of the King Library 's archives and museum in Atlanta , said the papers that Congress wants to buy include documents from King 's involvement with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference .",
            "But Cook said those papers were separated from another collection of SCLC papers donated to the King Center in 1977 , because Coretta Scott King kept them at her house .",
            "The two collections should be kept together for historical purposes , Cook said .",
            "`` Any scholar would consider them to be inseparable , '' Cook said .",
            "`` They are two separate collections , but had the documents held by Mrs. King been available at the time , they would have been considered as one . ''",
            "Both collections contain similar documents , including handwritten notes , drafts of speeches , reports and correspondence with major civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young .",
            "Cook left the King Center in 1987 over a fundamental disagreement with the way the papers were being stored and concern over the King estate charging fees to use the papers .",
            "`` I am gravely concerned about the future of the SCLC collection , as it has a very significant historical value for our nation and for scholars , '' Cook said .",
            "`` Because Dr. King was the founding president of SCLC , I do n't know how to distinguish what was his and what was SCLC 's . ''",
            "David Garrow , a historian at Emory University and King biographer , agrees with Cook 's assessment .",
            "`` The most important question right now is what does this mean for the SCLC papers and the SNCC ( Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ) papers ? ''",
            "Garrow said .",

            "Everything , to her and other food researchers , means the books kept in the library 's annex at 521 W. 43rd St. , off 10th Avenue .",
            "The annex was closed to the public in the spring of 1994 .",
            "The library decided that it was more efficient for the public to use annex materials at the main building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street , where security is better .",
            "Since then , researchers have had to request volumes at the main library and then wait days for them to be delivered .",
            "Some researchers warn that an irreplaceable trove of culinary knowledge is in disarray , as books are no longer delivered between floors but across town .",
            "Andrew Smith , who has written a history of ketchup and is awaiting publication of `` Popped Culture : A Social History of Popcorn '' by the University of South Carolina Press , said he flies to Washington to use the Library of Congress in preference to trying to get the research materials he needs from the New York library 's collection .",
            "`` It can take three days to get a book from the annex _ if you 're lucky , '' he said .",
            "`` Half the time , the books are missing or misplaced , and the condition they 're in is often a disaster . ''",

            "Jean Bowen , the library 's director of humanities , then informed Coe that the collection would be cleaned and put in protective boxes , and transferred to a storage center with zones of temperature and humidity controls .",

            "Once the books are transferred there , they will be delivered on request to Manhattan the next day .",
            "Though Coe wrote in his letter that he was alarmed by `` the specter of fragile materials being shipped back and forth on the New Jersey Turnpike , '' he offered his group 's help , including fund-raising , to preserve the culinary collection .",
            "Some books , he said , might not survive until the new center is finished .",

            "He also mentioned that one volume had been lost from Careme 's five-volume `` L'Art de la Cuisine Francais au 19th Siecle , '' published 145 years ago , and other volumes have pages torn or missing .",
            "On June 3 representatives of the library agreed to begin moving 17th- and 18th-century cookery volumes from the annex to the rare book room , where they will be more accessible .",

            "`` Mr. Coe gave us a very helpful list of rare books that are in the general collection , '' Ms. Bowen said .",
            "The transfer , which will begin with `` Le Nouveau et Parfaict Cuisinier '' ( 1668 ) by Pierre de Lune , is expected to take about a year .",
