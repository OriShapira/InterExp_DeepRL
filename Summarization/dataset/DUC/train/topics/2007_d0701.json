            "He was 89 and lived in Mansura , La .",
            "Oliver sued the Escude Funeral Home in Mansura , where he lived all his life , for discrimination after it refused to provide visitation for his deceased mother , Martha Pierre Oliver , because she was black .",
            "Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center , a civil rights organization in Montgomery , Ala. , advanced his case in federal court , charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks or offered `` distinctly inferior services '' for the same prices that they charged whites .",
            "Oliver won his case .",
            "Morris Dees , the chief trial counsel of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a member of the original team of lawyers that handled the case , said , `` Although the case was not binding , because it never reached the Supreme Court , it served notice to funeral homes , and even cemeteries and other businesses , that if they practiced discrimination against blacks they could be violating federal law . ''",
            "Dees said that after the ruling was announced , his organization heard reports from across the country that previously segregated funeral homes had begun to offer a full line of service to black clients .",
            "`` Nevertheless , '' he said , `` black funeral homes continue to prosper in the South as a matter of choice . ''",
            "Gaon Escude , a spokesman for the funeral home , said that his grandfather , who operated the home at the time of the lawsuit , provided all services , including embalming , but stopped at offering visitation to blacks `` because , if he did , he thought he 'd lose business from whites .

            "He added that his grandfather 's competitors at the time would not accept any black clients at all .",

            "`` He wanted a better place for visitation for his mother . ''",
            "After the Escude Funeral Home rejected his request , Oliver , a salesman for John Deere , arranged to hold the wake in what was described in his lawsuit as `` a run-down storage building on the grounds of Our Lady of Prompt Succor Church . ''",

            "'' I think it 's a rape of the American justice system . ''",

            "Their car backfired as it passed the Aryan Nations ' 20-acre compound .",
            "Security guards for the Aryan Nations mistook the backfire for a gunshot , piled into a truck and chased the Keenans , who are part white , part American Indian , for two miles .",
            "They fired five bullets into the Keenan car and forced it off the road .",
            "Both Keenans were punched and threatened at gunpoint before the guards backed off .",

            "Butler , however , has been largely able to escape jail time .",
            "In 1988 he was acquitted of federal charges that he was involved in a plot to overthrow the government .",
            "People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the white supremacist movement .",

            "In his suit here , Dees , a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center , seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son , both white , who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998 .",
            "The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan Nations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment .",
            "The suit contends that not only the guards but also the Aryan Nations , its 82-year-old founder , Richard Girnt Butler , and his second in command , Michael Teague , should be held liable , on the ground that they run their security force in a negligent manner and encourage violence .",
            "At the time of the assault , the guards said later , they thought they were under armed attack by militant Jews .",

            "Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he threw his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and , inadvertently , his wallet along with it .",

            "She and her son testified that they thought they were going to be killed .",
            "Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian .",

            "The rest is linguistic history .",
            "Three-year-olds know what going postal means .",
            "Is the Postal Service happy about this ?",
            "Not at all .",
            "So , calmly , it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety , a study that _ with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that your friendly letter carrier is likely , at any moment , to whip an Uzi out of his mail pouch .",
            "`` ` Going postal ' is a myth , a bad rap , '' the report says .",
            "`` Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault , sexually harass , or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the national workforce . ''",
            "Retail workers , it says , are eight times as likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work .",
            "The study is a serious one .",
            "`` The level of violence throughout the American workplace is unacceptably high , '' it says , and offers a variety of remedies .",
            "But it also seems intent on clearing the Postal Service 's tainted name , noting that part of the problem is that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer , it 's second only to Wal-Mart .",
            "But it will be rough .",
            "A new expression , once it has burst from the starting gate , is awfully hard to call back .",
            "And `` going Wal-Mart '' just does n't work .",
            "A Restaurant That 's All Lobby Washington lobbyists , shod in tasseled loafers , once inspired someone to describe their eager , sartorially enhanced gatherings outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci Gulch .",
            "Now they have their own watering hole , the Caucus Room , and the list of investors is top heavy with a who 's who of lobbyocracy .",
            "Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other Washington restaurant .",
            "Thomas H. Boggs Jr. , one of its largest investors and one of the town 's best-known lobbyists ( his father , Hale , was a Democratic leader in the the House , his mother , Lindy , a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the Vatican ) , provided a simple explanation .",
            "So many closed doors , he said , make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis Hastert , a Republican , and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt , a Democrat , from running into each other during fund-raising events .",
            "Not so incidentally , lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet , but only 50 percent for a regular meal .",
            "The roster of the Caucus Room 's 65 shareholders includes Michael Brown , the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown , as well as James Lake , the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign .",
            "It practically guarantees a full house nightly .",
            "And if political junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms carefully , they might just be able to figure out the behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick .",
            "In a town where politics has become a very nasty business , the lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one of their few bipartisan efforts , offering a culinary venue that fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse .",
            "A Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait & QL ; President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether to deploy a national missile defense system .",
            "He said he would not do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes .",
            "The president , speaking at Georgetown University , said he had decided not to act after two huge $ 100 million tests of the system failed to intercept incoming missiles .",
            "Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the United States and Russia and China , staunch opponents to a U.S. missile defense .",
            "& QL ; Temps , Unite & QL ; The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often receive inferior pay and benefits .",
            "But for years they were off limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user company and temp agency agreed _ something that rarely happened .",
            "The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency 's permission to do so .",
            "Awards After an Uprising More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971 Attica prison uprising will split $ 8 million as part of a settlement with New York state , a federal judge ruled .",
            "The awards , which range from $ 6,500 to $ 125,000 , punctuate a protracted legal battle stemming from the uprising , in which 43 people died .",
            "Still , the judge said many survivors `` remain casualties because of lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of Attica . ''",
            "No Terminator , Please The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the first robotic system that can design and build other robots with almost no human help .",

            "Crime Continues to Decline Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its lowest level since the government began its annual national crime survey 26 years ago .",
            "Law enforcement officials credited crime-prevention programs , anti-gun campaigns , more police on the street , tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs .",
            "The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999 , the Justice Department said , while crimes against property dropped 8.9 percent .",
            "But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and property crimes committed last year .",
            "The French and Corsica A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France 's political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement to resign in protest .",
            "Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive constitutional issue in France .",
            "But the plan has also gained wide backing , including from Corsicans , because it aims to strengthen moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists , who have thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three decades .",

            "The Aryan Nations compound has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years .",
            "His suit contends that compound guards , the Aryan Nations , its 82-year-old founder , Richard Girnt Butler , and his second in command , Michael Teague , should be held liable for an attack on a woman and her son , both white , by the guards in July 1998 .",
            "Dees ' goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to surrender their compound in payment .",

            "Many of those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were Hispanics and Asians , the nation 's fastest-growing minority groups .",

            "A Superior Court judge in Alameda County , Calif. , Michael E. Ballachey , largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995 .",
            "The judge said he intended to issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles .",

            "BIRMINGHAM , Ala. _ A federal grand jury has been hearing evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed four black girls in a downtown Birmingham church .",
            "In Louisiana , the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs in a small parish met last month with a prosecutor who recently began re-examining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush .",
            "And in Mississippi , a white man pleaded guilty this summer , and three others are to go on trial this week , in the 1970 killing of a black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river .",
            "Across the South , these and other unresolved , racially motivated killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new scrutiny .",
            "This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago killings , many of which had been ignored by authorities for years , was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers .",
            "For years , black community leaders and relatives of victims had complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and the lesser-known of these cases .",
            "But recently their urgings have been taken more seriously , experts and historians say , because the South 's political , social and legal climate has changed significantly since the era of the killings .",
            "Blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for these cases to be heard before today 's racially diverse juries .",
            "At the same time , more witnesses , perhaps with less fear of retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden , are coming forward .",
            "And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators , feeling an urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old , is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the South 's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism .",
            "`` In the South , we now have a black constituency that has political clout , and a white constituency that is not against these hatemongers being brought to justice , '' said David Sansing , professor emeritus of history at the University of Mississippi .",
            "`` And the black constituency , emboldened by new-found political power , is saying , ` Justice delayed is justice denied , so let 's quit denying this justice . '",
            "Surprisingly , they are being met with sympathy from district attorneys . ''",
            "At least seven of these long-dormant cases are currently being re-examined in the South .",
            "A few are before grand juries or are being prosecuted .",
            "But some have only just begun to be reinvestigated and have had little national attention .",
            "The officials pursuing these cases are mostly Southern and mostly white .",
            "Most are in their mid-40s to early 50s .",
            "A few have childhood memories of the crimes and of the violent reaction of the Ku Klux Klan to school integration and black voter registration .",
            "But they all share some sense that the decades-old cases are still a stumbling block to the South 's progress .",
            "`` These prosecutors , '' Sansing said , `` are realizing that they 've got to do it now , rather than leave it unsettled forever . ''",
            "For instance , U.S. Attorney Doug Jones , 45 , a Birmingham native , was 9 when Birmingham 's 16th Street Baptist Church , a center for civil rights activity in the 1960s , was bombed , killing the four girls .",
            "As a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to watch Bill Baxley , who was the Alabama attorney general , successfully prosecute the Klan leader Robert Chambliss for murder in the bombing .",
            "Baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time , in the hope that better cases could be developed against them later .",
            "When Jones became a U.S. attorney in 1997 , he pushed for the current grand jury investigation of others named in FBI files as suspects in the bombing .",
            "`` To be able to get back and reopen the case , and let the community know that it 's not forgotten , that 's important for everybody , '' Jones said .",
            "`` If you can bring it to closure , everyone can finish the healing process . ''",
            "Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today , said Morris Dees , executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Ala. , is that the FBI , which investigated some of the cases when they occurred , is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago .",
            "In the Birmingham case , for example , documents show that J. Edgar Hoover , who was then the FBI director , prevented bureau agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous evidence they had collected .",
            "Now it is the bureau that is leading the new investigation , along with Jones ' office .",
            "The re-examination of the Birmingham bombing was a result of meetings between local black religious and community leaders and local bureau officials in the mid-1990s .",
            "Officials close to the case now would not discuss specific evidence , but have said there are no new suspects , only new information .",
            "Still , there are hints at the direction in which the case is going .",
            "Of the three other suspects named in the original FBI report , two are living : Tommy Blanton Jr. in Birmingham and Bobby Frank Cherry in Texas .",
            "According to a book on the bombing , `` Until Justice Rolls Down , '' by a Birmingham News reporter , Frank Sikora , witnesses quoted in FBI files had named Cherry as the one who placed the bomb at the church .",
            "Blanton was said to have owned a car linked to the bombing .",
            "Both men have maintained their innocence .",
            "The bureau interviewed Cherry recently and some members of his family have appeared before the grand jury hearing the case .",
            "Also appearing before the grand jury this summer were two white supremacists J.B. Stoner and Robert Shelton .",
            "Stoner was convicted in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell with Chambliss .",
            "Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a few suspects in these kinds of slayings , but the statute of limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as well as in all the other cases from that time .",
            "Jones said that his office was looking into using a federal law with no statute of limitations concerning the transport of dynamite in the bombing .",
            "He said there is also a possibility of using state murder charges , which have no statute of limitations , as was done in 1977 against Chambliss .",
            "But murder was the charge in the successful conviction in 1994 in Jackson , Miss. , of the former Klansman , Byron De La Beckwith , who shot to death Evers , the field secretary of the Mississippi National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , .",
            "The conviction came after two prosecutions of Beckwith ended in mistrials in the 1960s .",
            "The case inspired the film `` Ghosts of Mississippi . ''",
            "`` The Medgar Evers case was a wedge in the dam , '' said Dees of the law center , which keeps track of hate crimes and first called attention to many of the unresolved killings with racial links .",
            "`` It gave everyone a tremendous amount of hope . ''",
            "( STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn That hope helped to stir the call for reopening the Birmingham case .",

            "In 1998 , a former Klan leader , Sam Bowers , was convicted of the fire-bombing murder of Dahmer , the Hattiesburg NAACP president .",
            "Inspired by those successes , other families have begun pushing in the past year for answers in some of the lesser-known , long-ago slayings linked to race .",
            "`` The South is still in the process of a cleansing moment with these cases , '' said Myrlie Evers-Williams , 66 , widow of Medgar Evers and chairwoman emeritus of the NAACP .",
            "`` I 'm so thankful that others who have suffered the same injustice as we did have moved forth .",
            "To see that pebble dropped in the water and the ripples go out says something about justice in this country .",
            "There is still hope . ''",
            "Still , not everyone is happy that these cases are back in the public spotlight .",
            "Many prosecutors said they had been asked over and over why they wanted to stir up trouble .",
            "`` I 'll hear it from white people on the golf course , '' said Bob Helfrich , 45 , the assistant district attorney in Hattiesburg who prosecuted Bowers and plans to prosecute Charles Noble , another man charged in the Dahmer case , next spring .",
            "`` They say , ` Have n't we spent enough money on this ? '",
            "I have blacks tell me not to mess with this , too .",

            "In Birmingham , at a recent ceremony at the 16th Street Church commemorating the victims of the bombing , police officers stood guard outside .",
            "The church 's pastor , the Rev .",
            "Christopher Hamlin , said such vigilance is necessary because the church has continued to receive bomb threats , especially in the three years since the case was reopened .",
            "Across the street from the church , on a recent sunny day , Ronald Roscoe , 47 , a heating and air-conditioning technician , who is black , was spending his lunch break in Kelly Ingram Park , near the church 's memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing .",
            "A city gardener using a leaf blower reminded Roscoe of the images from three decades ago of police officers wielding fire hoses in the park to disperse civil rights protesters .",
            "Referring to the reopening of the bombing case , Roscoe said : `` It 's a waste of time .",
            "I wish them luck , but after all this time I do n't believe the guys who did the bombing are ever going to be convicted . ''",
            "Nearby , Shane Buggay , 32 , an orthopedic surgeon , who is white , disagreed .",

            "And officials in Philadelphia , Miss. , despite urging from the families of the victims , are not saying publicly whether they are investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18 men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of three civil rights workers there in 1964 .",
            "Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges , including Bowers , but none has ever been tried by the state for the Philadelphia killings .",
            "Baxley , the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the Birmingham bombing case in 1977 , said some of the same problems he encountered 20 years ago still exist .",
            "For instance , he said his main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss , by then a frail 74-year-old , was once capable of killing four children .",
            "`` It worried me , '' Baxley said , `` that they would look at him and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody .",
            "So we had to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or uncle .",
            "They had to see the evil in this man . ''",
            "Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging witnesses with failing memories , or key witnesses who have already died .",
            "In some of the slayings , no case files exist and no transcripts from trials on federal charges exist , as they do in better-known cases like the Evers slaying , the killings of the Philadelphia , Miss. , rights workers and the Birmingham church bombing .",
            "Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan .",
            "Two major witnesses , whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in the bombing , refused to testify .",
