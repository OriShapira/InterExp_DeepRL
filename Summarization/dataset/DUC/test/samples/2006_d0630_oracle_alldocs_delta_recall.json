                "The booksellers ' association , based in Tarrytown , N.Y. , will begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book Sense brand , which in some ways is inspired by the example of the independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True Value label .",

                "Battered by chain stores and the on-line giant Amazon.com , one out of every three of New England 's independent booksellers has created sophisticated yet quirky Web sites in the past two years in an effort to lure patrons and keep their doors open .",
                "For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category , online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share , which declined less than one percentage point , to 16.6 percent .",
