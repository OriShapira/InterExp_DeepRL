                "The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993 .",
                "Lawrence 's parents , Neville and Doreen Lawrence , who are natives of Jamaica , gave the report a guarded welcome , though they said they were disappointed it had not called for the prosecution of five suspects in their son 's murder for perjury .",
                "Lawrence 's death and the bungled police investigation that failed to bring his killers to justice generated an extraordinary level of anger and frustration among blacks that last year , after more than five years of pressure , finally moved the government to conduct a formal inquiry .",
                "The brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence , 18 , by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate adequately prompted a national debate on racism and how police handle such crimes .",
                "LONDON , September 7 ( Xinhua ) -- The Prince of Wales Thursday launched a scholarship to try to open up architecture to the ethnic minorities , in memory of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence .",
                "Home Secretary Jack Straw , the Cabinet minister in charge of the police , announced that laws making racial discrimination an offense will be broadened to include the police and all government departments .",
                "The case against the prime suspects has never been officially prosecuted , though they were tried and acquitted when lawyers acting for Stephen 's parents instituted what is known in Britain as a private prosecution against them .",
                "The Independent : -- The five men suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence were thumped and pelted with bottles by an enraged crowd Tuesday after a day of evasive and implausible evidence that made a mockery of their appearance before the public inquiry .",
                "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn That there may be racism in the Metropolitan Police hardly seems surprising in a city where 20 percent of the population , but only 2.3 percent of the police force , is made up of people from minority groups ."
