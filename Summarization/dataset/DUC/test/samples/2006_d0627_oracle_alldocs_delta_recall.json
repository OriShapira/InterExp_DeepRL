                "The anxiety among prospective parents -- and among adoption practitioners throughout the United States -- stems from a series of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption practices within that country and , as a result , possibly change the face of international adoption .",
                "The treaty , called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions , is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption , streamline the process , and weed out corruption worldwide .",
                "A draft of the Adoption Law has relaxed restrictions in many aspects for Chinese and foreigners who apply for adoptions , according to a member of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , Wan Shaofen , who was debating the draft .",
                "While nowadays , more children are adopted each year from Russia and China , South Korea 's system remains the model for international adoptions , and there are more than 100,000 adopted Koreans in the United States .",
                "It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two worlds _ one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to make them a family , and the other with older children in foster care looking for parents _ whose orbits rarely connect .",
                "Delahunt said that partly because this country takes in about 80 percent of the world 's adoptees , US ratification also would serve as a global model and would apply pressure even on nations not under the treaty to raise their standards and improve their treatment of children .",
                "So while the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been subtle , the increase in visibility has been dramatic , enhanced by those children adopted from other countries whose physical differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact .",
                "The most important immediate result , according to nearly everyone interviewed , is that nations with concerns about American adoption practices _ most pointedly Russia and Romania , which have recently halted the adoption of their children _ will be reassured about the US commitment to reform ."
