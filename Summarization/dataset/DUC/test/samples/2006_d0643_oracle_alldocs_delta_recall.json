                "Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina .",
                "When they altered the values for the magnitude of deep ocean waves at a single point in the western Pacific , the model produced El Nino at regular intervals of about four years , with perfectly predictable cycles of temperature , winds and ocean currents .",
                "IN December , scientists from the Woods Hole Research Laboratory in Massachusetts reported in the journal Nature that during El Nino years that bring hot , dry weather to the Amazon , Brazil 's rain forest sends out more carbon dioxide gas , trapping heat in the atmosphere .",
                "The meeting will provide scientific and technical information on the current status of El Nino , as one of the major forces acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect weather patterns in many areas of the globe .",
                "La Nina 's impacts include heavy rains , severe storms and flooding in southern Africa , drought in Kenya and Tanzania , flooding in the Philippines and Indonesia and abnormal wetness in northern South America .",
                "That 's the conclusion of climatologist Stanley A. Changnon , who calculated that while the 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 deaths , it also can be credited with preserving 850 lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons .",
                "LONDON , April 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate , the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean , scientists suggested Thursday .",
                "Those conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean ; shifting of precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific ; slowing of trade winds ; and changes in sea level .",
                "Bangladesh 's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization ( SPARRSO ) is monitoring the El Nino phenomenon , which is responsible for rains or drought world-wide , to help the country 's farmers cope with its effects , SPARRSO director Dr ."
