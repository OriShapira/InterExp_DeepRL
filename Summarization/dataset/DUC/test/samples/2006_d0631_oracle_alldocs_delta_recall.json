                "Three weeks ago , Continental acknowledged that a strip of metal found on the runway among debris from the plane was similar in shape to a piece missing from its DC-10 , which had been heading for New Jersey just minutes before the doomed Concorde took off .",
                "The July 25 crash , the first in the Concorde 's 24 years of commercial service , killed all 109 people aboard , mainly German tourists , and four on the ground .",
                "Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday quoted Gayssot , the transport minister , as raising the possibility that the ban on Air France Concorde flights could remain in place until the Accident and Inquiry Office releases a preliminary report on the crash at the end of August .",
                "Only 20 of the planes were ever built , and just 13 of those were still in service , seven with British Air and six with Air France , which grounded its planes immediately after the accident .",
                "The sleek , needle-nosed aircraft could cross the Atlantic at an altitude of 60,000 feet and at 1,350 mph , completing the trip from London to New York in less than four hours -- half the time of regular jets .",
                "The Concorde has been plying scheduled trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years and had come to be seen as an icon of prestigious travel for executives and celebrities ready to pay up to $ 10,000 for a round-trip ticket .",
                "The agency said that an identical metal band that is believed to have gashed a tire on the supersonic jet , causing huge chunks of rubber to pierce the plane 's fuel tanks , was reported missing by Continental .",
                "Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France , which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse , a small town nine miles northeast of Paris .",
                "But because the Concorde makes far fewer flights than most aircraft , that one crash gave it one of the worst safety records for passenger aircraft ."
