                "But instead of the expected anger from separatists , there was satisfaction over another part of the court 's declaration : that federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum .",
                "QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti Quebecois have retained control of Canada 's largest province , possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest of Canada , and possibly another referendum on independence .",
                "OTTAWA , May 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum .",
                "In the final results of Monday 's election , his separatist Parti Quebecois won 75 seats , two fewer than in 1994 , while the Liberal Party , which favors keeping Quebec in Canada , won 48 , an increase of one .",
                "And to the rest of Canada , and Charest 's supporters in Quebec , secession is such a soul-searing issue that it was assumed that weariness with referendums must necessarily translate into a big vote for the federalists .",
                "According to published reports , separatist leaders planned to declare independence and gain recognition of the new country from France and the United States within days after the 1995 referendum if they had won , despite promises of a period of negotiation with the rest of Canada .",
                "Polls indicate that most Quebecers do not want to be put through another referendum , but that they believe the threat of separation is useful to bringing about changes in Canada .",
                "In the most recent episode , which aired just a week before the Nov. 30 elections for control of the provincial government , the characters addressed the serious question of independence in a way that Canadians elsewhere in the nation would have trouble understanding .",
                "Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat , and won a power struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the separatists would win ."
