                "The tentative agreements reached Tuesday between the UAW , GM and its former parts division Delphi Automotive Systems provide 185,000 workers with 3 percent pay raises each year for four years and a signing bonus of $ 1,350 , a source close to the talks said .",
                "Such a settlement could have major implications for GM In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits from the automaker , not the subsidiary .",

                "Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers and parts workers , but they disposed of many of their parts factories piecemeal in the late 1970s and early 1980s , when their survival was in doubt .",
                "GM says that transferring production south has enabled it to cut costs in labor-intensive assembly production , compete more effectively against Ford , Chrysler and Japanese automakers , and also to keep engineering and other operations in the United States .",
                "Wade McCaleb , secretary-treasurer of Local 1895 , said workers at Visteon plants would remain Ford employees , while any new employees at Visteon will be covered by an agreement between the new company and the UAW that mirrors the one the union has with Ford .",

                "The UAW is accusing the General Motors Corp. of spending billions of dollars on factories in developing countries while failing to invest in aging American factories .",
                "FLINT , Mich. _ Negotiators worked steadily Wednesday to resolve a monthlong strike at General Motors auto parts factories here , but more signs emerged that any deal would address local disputes and might not produce big improvements in GM 's competitiveness ."
