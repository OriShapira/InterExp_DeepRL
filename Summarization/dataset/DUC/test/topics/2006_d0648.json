            "CHICAGO ( AP ) _ Newly published research confirms that drugs are effective in treating children with obsessive-compulsive disorder , an illness that afflicts hundreds of thousands of youngsters across America .",
            "The newest medication shown safe and effective in compulsive youngsters is sertraline , marketed as Zoloft , according to the study in Wednesday 's Journal of the American Medical Association .",
            "`` There are lots of kids who are undiagnosed , or if they are diagnosed are not being treated , '' said the study 's lead author , Dr. John S. March of Duke University Medical Center .",
            "He said drugs work best when combined with psychotherapy .",
            "The findings bring to three the number of similar drugs that have worked well in large trials among compulsive children at multiple medical centers , said Dr. Judith L. Rapoport of the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institutes of Health .",
            "The Food and Drug Administration used the study , funded by Zoloft maker Pfizer Inc. , as evidence for approving the drug for treating OCD in children .",
            "It already had been approved for the disorder in adults .",
            "The other OCD drugs approved for both age groups are clomipramine , marketed as Anafranil , and fluvoxamine , marketed as Luvox .",
            "In addition , the antidepressant fluoxetine , marketed as Prozac , has been reported in small trials to work well in childhood OCD , Rapoport said .",
            "Like the other drugs , Prozac buoys brain levels of serotonin , a chemical messenger between nerves that is key in mood , sleep and appetite .",
            "Its role in OCD is unknown , but sufferers of OCD often have overlapping problems with depression , anxiety or eating disorders , previous studies show .",
            "Hallmarks of OCD are senseless and repetitive thoughts and behaviors that typically deal with grooming , contamination or danger .",
            "An example would be excessive hand-washing .",
            "Up to half of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder show the first signs of it in childhood .",
            "And up to half of children identified with OCD respond to drug treatment , Rapoport wrote in an editorial accompanying the study .",
            "Estimates of the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder range from 0.5 percent to 1 percent of U.S. school-age children , or about 250,000 to 500,000 youngsters ."

            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- What drives some bodybuilders is a form of mental illness that can be treated with drugs , a researcher says .",
            "These people have a type of body dysmorphic disorder , a condition which is characterized by a preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance , said Dr. Eric Hollander of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York .",
            "`` Body dysmorphic disorder affects probably 1 to 2 percent of the U.S. population , but among men in particular there is a sort of subclassification called 'bigorexia , ' which is sort of the opposite of anorexia , '' Hollander said .",
            "Anorexics think they are too fat , no matter how thin they are -- and bigorexics think themselves too small , no matter how big they are , he said .",
            "Bigorexia , more properly termed muscle dysmorphia , is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric condition , Hollander said .",
            "But the coming revision of the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual will describe the condition , he said .",
            "Bodybuilding can be a healthy competition , but these people take muscle development to the point at which it interferes with ordinary living , including holding a job or staying healthy , Hollander said .",
            "`` They will continue to exercise even after they have dislocated a shoulder , '' he said .",
            "As an expression of body dysmorphic disorder , muscle dysmorphia is an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder , Hollander said .",
            "People with OCD are driven to do things such as repeatedly check their appearance in mirrors and perform ritualistic movements .",
            "`` An exaggerated sense that something does n't look right '' seems to have origins in brain chemistry , Hollander said .",
            "He and his colleagues reported in Archives of General Psychiatry on the effects of the drug clomipramine on the brain chemical serotonin .",
            "One of serotonin 's normal roles seems to be in turning off brain processes that signal when `` things do n't fit our conceived notions , '' Hollander said .",
            "If serotonin levels are abnormally low , however , it ca n't turn off the mental alarm bell that rings when things do n't seem right , and the bell keeps on ringing even when things are right , he said .",
            "Clomipramine helps the brain raise serotonin levels by interfering with the body 's ability to destroy the chemical , he said .",
            "Hollander and his colleagues wanted to be sure clomipramine was producing improvements in the behavior of people with body dysmorphic disorder , and that the patients were not improving simply because they knew they were getting treatment and therefore expected themselves to improve .",
            "So the researchers compared clomipramine with another drug , desipramine , which had similar side effects but does not affect serotonin .",
            "Clomipramine treatment was significantly better in reducing patients ' repetitive movements and obsessive preoccupation with perceived flaws , the study found .",
            "But it is not a cure , Hollander said .",
            "`` Do n't think about symptoms going down to zero , '' he said .",
            "`` They were 25 to 35 percent improved . ''",
            "There was , however , a significant improvement in their ability to go back to school or function at work , and a significant drop in their thoughts of suicide , he said .",
            "Although this study did not focus on muscle dysmorphia , treatment for body dysmorphia has been shown to work on muscle dysmorphia , Hollander said .",
            "And a clinician who was not involved in the study said she found the drug to work , especially in combination with psychological therapy .",
            "`` I do n't feel behavior therapy is sufficient , and certainly medications are not efficacious alone either , '' said Fugen Neziroglu , senior clinical director of the Bio-Behavioral Institute in Great Neck , N.Y. Neziroglu has treated a number of people with muscle dysmorphia .",
            "`` I had one who just left , an attractive , nice , 44-year-old man , he 's telling me he has flab on his sides , '' she said .",
            "`` You look at him and you know he has no flab . ''",
            "Medications help to stabilize patients with muscle dysmorphia , but therapy is needed to retrain habits and thought patterns needed to make the improvements last , Neziroglu said .",
            "Clomipramine is one of the better drugs , she said .",
            "And therapy alone may be adequate treatment , said James Rosen , a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Vermont .",
            "The cognitive-behavioral approach teaches patients to realize when their thoughts are unrealistic , recast their self-image into more neutral terms , and adapt to situations that could set off the compulsion , he said .",
            "For muscle dysmorphia , this could include easing away from the idea that the exercisers would lose control of themselves if they skip a workout , Rosen said .",
            "However , one bodybuilding promoter said he could n't tell whether bodybuilders have this condition .",
            "High-level bodybuilders are like other athletes in paying extremely close attention to what they eat , how much they exercise and where they fall short of their own goals , said James Lorimer of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Fitness Weekend , Feb. 22-27 in Columbus , Ohio .",
            "`` I ca n't say I place these particular athletes outside the normal range of people who are trying to be the best they can be in whatever sport they are in , '' Lorimer said .",
            "`` You can say it 's excessive , it 's unusual , but ( I ) ca n't say whether it is disordered or not . ''"

            "The department is also being questioned about its handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen , Eric Harris , had threatened a classmate over the Internet , a matter that is now under investigation .",
            "Among the corrections of the sheriff 's statements : Three students in black trench coats who were detained at Columbine last Tuesday and then released are not targets of the investigation , but in fact have been cleared .",
            "The videotape showing the carnage in the cafeteria is still being analyzed , and may not show the gunmen firing at the students .",
            "There is no evidence that Harris and his friend Dylan Klebold , the other gunman , tried to escape and were stopped by sheriff 's deputies .",
            "Investigators are eager to make arrests , but there is no indication they will come as soon as Friday .",
            "`` The sheriff ca n't know every single detail in a case this huge , '' Parr said gently , noting that there are 35 investigators from a half-dozen police agencies chasing down hundreds of leads , plus another 40 officers analyzing evidence inside the school .",

            "`` We 're looking into everything that might be the cause and might be preventable in the future , but at this time were not looking at what would have caused them to commit the crime , as much as whether anyone else would be involved . ''",
            "The authorities said on Wednesday that they still think that others might have helped Harris and Klebold carry out their deadly mission and have `` high hopes '' for future arrests .",
            "But so far , no suspects have been identified .",
            "Among the crucial pieces of evidence in last Tuesday 's shocking spree are videotapes taken from security cameras in the cafeteria , where the carnage began , that are being enhanced and reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .",

            "It has been a trying week for the relatively small agency _ it has a similar number of officers as one of New York 's largest precincts _ as hundreds of journalists with almost as many television cameras ask thousands of questions .",
            "In addition to Wednesday 's clarifications , and the revised death toll , the department has also made several adjustments to the timetable of when police officers arrived on the scene and how long the gunmen were shooting .",
            "`` We 've been giving a lot of interviews , '' said Parr , who was the department 's media spokesman for three years before Davis took over in January 1988 .",
            "`` Occasionally we 'll have misunderstandings . ''",

            "`` It was just a misinterpretation . ''",
            "This is by far the most grisly and high-profile crime in the department 's history ; the last media swarm was when the scion of the Coors brewing company was killed in the county in the 1960 's , long before the days of 24-hour television news channels .",
            "There were seven murders in the county all of 1998 , and four each of the previous years .",

            "And the number of kids on medication is rising .",
            "A study by Dr. Julie Magno Zito at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore found that as many as 1.5 percent of American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking stimulants such as Ritalin , as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics .",
            "According to Zito 's findings , stimulant use in this age group ( Ritalin in 90 percent of the cases ) rose two- to threefold from 1991 to 1995 , while the rate of antidepressant prescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period .",
            "As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric problems , the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem , especially in younger age groups , says Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz , vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in New York City .",
            "`` We have a critical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of these medications in children , '' he says .",
            "Dr. Jerry Rushton , a pediatrician at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor , says that clinicians simply know more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past _ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of diagnoses and prescriptions .",
            "According to Rushton , heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s , which provided evidence that identifiable , biologically-based mental illnesses , such as depression , can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old .",
            "Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions , says Rushton , is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , including Prozac , Zoloft and Paxil , which have fewer , less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants .",
            "They have been increasingly prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating depression , obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children .",
            "Does the rising use of medications indicate that rates of mental illnesses are actually increasing among children ?",
            "`` For over a decade there have been observations among teachers and pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in children , '' says Dr. Barry Zuckerman , chairman of the department of pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine .",
            "`` We do n't know if it has to do with changing communities , family structure , TV video games or anything else , but there is a perception that behavioral disturbances are on the rise . ''",
            "A case in point is ADHD , which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 .",
            "In 1987 , the APA redefined the criteria for diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior , and not necessarily both , as was previously the case .",
            "The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD diagnoses .",
            "Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4 percent to 12 percent of all American children _ some 2.5 million _ are now thought to have the disorder , making it the most common pediatric mental illness in the United States .",
            "And according to Zito , the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD .",
            "Parents who consult a professional about their child 's behavior will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental health coverage is concerned .",
            "`` There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness , managed care interferes with diagnosis , '' says Dr. Alan Wachtel , a clinical associate professor at New York University Medical Center in New York City and author of `` The Attention Deficit Disorder Answer Book . ''",
            "Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists , limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions .",
            "And , according to Koplewicz , most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists , but by pediatricians , many of whom have little training in mental health .",
            "By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals , managed care companies are limiting the resources available to pediatricians , he says , which may add pressure to reach for the prescription pad .",
            "Experts , including Koplewicz , say that children with mental illness who do n't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others , and are at a much higher risk of delinquency , occupational problems and suicide later on in life .",
            "If you are worried that your pediatrician can not devote the time needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because of an overwhelming schedule , ask for a recommendation to a qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment , which should include in-depth interviews with the child , parents and teachers , and a review of school records and family history .",
            "Unfortunately , many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed care places on physicians , says Dr. Peter Jensen , the director of the Center for the Advancement of Children 's Mental Health at the Columbia University School of Medicine in New York City .",
            "But , he says , the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of the child 's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the child .",
            "In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted , a team of researchers at six sites around the country , led by Jensen , followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment .",
            "The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone .",
            "In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD , such as depression or anxiety , combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage .",
            "Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving .",
            "Because so few of these studies have been completed , a consensus among experts on the benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to emerge .",
            "Ultimately , parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child , says Koplewicz .",
            "After the evaluation , he says , `` the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis , as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration . ''",

            "A highly respected neuroscientist has developed a provocative new theory of how the brain is organized which , if confirmed , would explain how and why the mind produces symptoms found in several seemingly unrelated disorders .",
            "According to the theory , the deep sadness in severe depression , the hand wringing in obsessive compulsive disorder , the ringing in the ears of tinnitus , the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the shaking and immobility seen Parkinson 's disease all stem from the same basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that normally fire their cells in synchrony .",
            "If the theory is correct , it would explain why a experimental surgical techniques involving implanting electrodes in the brain to treat Parkinson 's disease and depression seem to work so well , and it would expand their application to other brain diseases .",
            "The neuroscientist , Dr. Rodolfo Llinas , a professor at New York University Medical School , presented his findings on last Sunday night in Miami to some 4,000 researchers attending the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting .",
            "Although the theory has not yet been subjected to peer review , a paper describing the work was submitted last week to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and accepted for publication in just two days .",
            "Llinas is a member of the academy , which often publishes the work of leading scientists or their proteges when the ideas are new and have not yet been tested by others .",
            "`` This work is very important , '' said Dr. Edward Jones , president of the Society for Neuroscience and director of the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California in Davis .",
            "`` What makes it so compelling is that it does n't come completely out of left field .",
            "It builds on a body of work that 's been growing for some time .",
            "Everyone will say wow , yes ! ''",
            "Because these new insights into brain organization , if confirmed , would almost certainly promote the use of surgery to treat psychiatric and neurological diseases , other scientists urged caution in applying the theory .",
            "They are concerned because psychosurgeries that were tried 30 to 40 years ago in these same regions of the brain made many people mentally incompetent .",
            "The theory involves two brain areas _ the cerebral cortex and the thalamus _ and how they communicate .",
            "The cortex is a thickly folded band of tissue that carries out higher mental capacities in humans and other mammals .",
            "It is composed of six layers of cells that are highly interconnected and organized into specialized regions that allow people to move their bodies , plan for the future , talk , listen , sense touch , respond to emotions and carry out other functions .",
            "The sixth layer of these cells is also directly connected through nerve fibers to cells in the thalamus , an older brain structure that is just under the cortex .",
            "The thalamus is usually thought of as a relay station .",
            "Virtually all information flowing from the outside world and lower brain regions must go through the thalamus before being passed on to the cortex .",
            "But according to Llinas , the thalamus does much more than simply pass information .",
            "The way that it coordinates its activity with the cortex , he says , gives rise not only to the symptoms seen in many neurological and psychiatric diseases , but to consciousness itself .",
            "It does so through what Llinas calls thalamo-cortical oscillations .",
            "The thalamus contains special cells that pass tiny electrical currents across their membranes in a highly coordinated manner , Llinas said in a telephone interview .",
            "Rather than firing sporadically and singly , like other nerve cells , the cells in the thalamus oscillate , firing in groups together at various frequencies .",
            "By virtue of their connections , these thalamic cel cause cells in layer six _ the layer of the cortex closest to them _ to oscillate at the same frequency .",
            "This coordination between these oscillating cells in the cortex and thalamus , which are constantly flipping signals back and forth , binds information from different regions of the brain into complete actions , perceptions , movements and into consciousness itself , he said .",
            "When the cells oscillate at a high frequency , the brain is awake and alert .",
            "When they fall into low frequencies , the brain becomes disconnected , unconscious and falls asleep .",
            "In studying patients with various brain diseases , Llinas and his colleagues noticed that particular regions of their thalamuses oscillated at abnormally low frequencies , as if those regions were asleep .",
            "When this happens , Llinas said , key parts of the cortex are decoupled from the thalamus .",
            "Those parts of the cortex then become overly excited because they are no longer under proper control , he said , and symptoms of dysfunction emerge .",
            "For example , a defect in one tiny part of the thalamus that projects to one of the higher areas controlling movements can cause those movements to become uncoordinated .",
            "The result is the tremors seen in Parkinson 's disease .",
            "If the defect is a fraction of an inch away , a different part of the region controlling movement is affected , resulting in the rigidity seen in many patients .",
            "Chronic-pain sufferers also have sluggish regions of the thalamus , Llinas said .",
            "Areas of the cortex that deal with pain become overexcited , producing intense discomfort that does not respond to drugs .",
            "Llinas speculates that the same underlying defect causes some types of depression , most tinnitus and obsessive compulsive disease .",
            "In each case , according to his theory , a part of the thalamus is out of phase with the cortex which , unregulated , produces symptoms of profound sadness , ringing in the ears or endless hand washing .",
            "All these disorders might be treated by implanting electrodes into the thalamus to break the abnormal oscillation patterns , Llinas said .",
            "The most effective treatment for Parkinson 's patients who do not respond to drug therapy involves putting electrodes directly into the thalamus .",
            "`` This breaks the abnormal disconnection and the person immediately gets better , '' Llinas said .",
            "`` But you have to keep the electrode in .",
            "It 's like a pacemaker . ''",
            "Similar surgeries have been tried successfully for chronic pain and depression .",
