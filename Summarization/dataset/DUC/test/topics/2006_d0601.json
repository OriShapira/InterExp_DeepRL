            "_ There was no Christmas vacation this year at the Omaha Nation Public School , and no spring break either .",
            "Instead , the superintendent , Todd Chessmore , decided to front load the school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early , the first week of May .",
            "This was his attempt to stem a chronically high truancy rate that gets worse in the spring , when warmer weather and the end of the high school basketball season dampen students ' interest in school .",
            "It was not entirely successful .",
            "In the math class taught by Chessmore , for example , only five of the 36 registered students were showing up by mid-April .",
            "Even in a country used to stories about struggling public schools , many of those in Indian country stand out .",
            "Last year , the average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national standardized tests , and almost half scored below the 10th percentile .",
            "Fewer than half the students in grades three through 12 came to take the test , Chessmore said .",
            "And while this year 's graduating class of nine is bigger than those of a few years ago , it represents only a third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade .",
            "The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country .",
            "On average , 36 percent to 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school , according to the American Indian College Fund , the largest dropout rate of any ethnic group .",
            "Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to college , and most do not finish .",
            "`` We got the worst of everything , the lowest test scores , lowest rate of reading books , the highest dropout rate , the lowest rate of entering college , '' said Dean Chavers , director of the Native American Scholarship Fund .",
            "`` Whatever test you 're looking at , Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th percentile .",
            "The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent .",
            "Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 _ no geometry , no trig _ and people wonder why they 're failing out of college . ''",
            "Frustrated by years of distressing results , schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings , programs to train Indian teachers , and support for parents whose poverty , substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve .",
            "The effort reflects the Indians ' increasing ability to assert itself , as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos .",
            "But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education .",
            "Some reservation schools have done well and others , including the Omaha Nation school , have improved from a few years ago .",
            "But many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian teachers , a generation of poorly educated parents , broken and overwhelmed families , a society historically suspicious of government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the relationship between being academically rigorous and being successful on the reservation .",
            "These difficulties only compound the isolation and poverty of reservation life .",
            "`` I worry about the future of the tribe , '' said Denine Parker , an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy , where 60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed .",
            "`` I see too many kids not getting an education .",
            "What happens to them ?",
            "All you have to do is walk Main Street and then you know . ''",
            "To some degree , state and federal officials are responding .",
            "President Clinton 's budget request this year includes the largest increase ever for Indian education , economic and social programs _ $ 1.2 billion _ which would put it at $ 9.4 billion in 2001 .",
            "The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers .",
            "Currently , most teachers in reservation schools are non-Indian , the turnover rates are extremely high , and many believe the teachers do not understand Indian culture and learning styles .",
            "And in August , a task force Clinton created will present plans to improve education of the nation 's 600,000 Indian students , 90 percent of whom are in public schools , many on reservations .",
            "`` What 's important is that what the government is doing says it 's OK to be an Indian , '' said David Cournoyer , director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund .",
            "`` Before the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person .",
            "Now there 's a recognition that the Indian 's background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students . ''",
            "Dr. David Beaulieu , the Education Department 's director of Indian education , called the effort unprecedented .",
            "`` We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children , '' Beaulieu said .",
            "`` In the 1990s we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before . ''",
            "( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM ) In Nebraska , the efforts of Chessmore and others got the state to hold an Indian education summit meeting and appoint a task force to improve state policy .",
            "The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so tribes , which have very little taxable property , would no longer lose state financing because they can not raise the required amount from property taxes .",
            "The bill was vetoed by Nebraska 's governor , and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state .",
            "Chris Peterson , a spokesman for Gov .",
            "Mike Johanns , said that while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill , he also believed `` it is time for the state and federal government to step up and do more , specifically in the area of funding . ''",
            "And Nebraska 's education commissioner , Doug Christensen , is hiring two staff members solely for Indian students : an education expert and a drug and alcohol counselor .",
            "`` We 're really courting disaster , I think , on those reservation communities , '' said Christensen .",
            "`` In two of our reservation schools there are 44 kindergartners but only two seniors , and in one case those two kids should not be graduating .",
            "They are two 18-year-old girls who could n't pass the Algebra 1 test to save their soul . ''",
            "Bob Geist , principal of the Winnebago reservation school , north of Macy , said `` some parents see formal education as important , others see just being with the family as education .",
            "We have parents who will take kids out of school just to go shopping , or schedule a haircut in the middle of the day . ''",
            "( END OPTIONAL TRIM ) nn & UR ; & QL ; & LR ; Parker , the Omaha Nation teacher who regularly sees only 15 out of 26 students in her largest class , sent her daughter to sixth grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa .",
            "Recently , her daughter returned to Omaha Nation school to find she was `` way ahead of the sixth graders here , '' Parker said .",
            "`` If I never would have sent her away , she never would have realized how hard she has to work . ''",
            "Still , at Omaha Nation , Chessmore has made many improvements , from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help girls who have babies stay in school .",
            "He started a training program for Indian teachers that will increase their numbers from 4 to 20 , made the curriculum more culturally relevant , and has applied for money for a social services center with probation officers and a mental health counselor .",
            "He received a grant for a reading program for elementary students , which has produced `` fourth graders who are reading better than half our high school . ''",
            "And he is lobbying the telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students ' families without them .",
            "To build trust , Chessmore , unlike most superintendents and teachers in reservation schools , enrolled his seven children at Omaha Nation , the only non-Indians among the 470 students .",
            "He and his wife also raise four Indian students from troubled families .",
            "He hired three truant officers , and the truancy rate fell from 31 percent to about 15 percent .",
            "One afternoon , Waylon Oldman , a truant officer and tribe member , scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school .",
            "In a Buick with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants , Oldman visited one boy 's father and the trailer where the other boy lived with his grandmother .",
            "He scaled a chalky ridge called Million Dollar Hill , poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees , scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge , and combed an algae-choked creek strewn with old tires ..",
            "The truants were nowhere to be seen .",
            "`` The kids are smart _ they arrange tree branches so they can scoot underneath but we have to work to get through , '' Oldman said .",
            "He said tribal court has begun fining parents whose children were chronically truant , and the school sometimes tried to get their welfare benefits cut .",
            "`` Some parents are really concerned , but some of the parents do n't really understand why they need to send the kids to school . ''",
            "One chronic truant was Janice & UR ; & LR ; Baxter 's 16-year-old son .",
            "She would take him to school in the morning , but said that `` in the afternoon , I would see him walking around with friends . ''",
            "Baxter said he kept `` coming home drunk '' and she sent him to a treatment center .",
            "Some students show promise but do n't follow through .",
            "This year , it looked like Jason Miller , a senior on the basketball team , would graduate , but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season ended .",
            "`` I did n't really want to come to school no more , '' said Jason , 18 .",
            "But there have been successes .",
            "One senior , Liz Parker , had slacked off too badly to graduate .",
            "But a few weeks ago , Chessmore refused to let his daughter double date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate .",
            "She did .",
            "And Adrienne Miller , 19 , who was left back in ninth grade and was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks , turned things around under pressure from her mother , who told her she would have to help pay the bills if she was n't in school .",
            "Now she 'll graduate and plans to attend college .",

            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- American Indian reservations would get an infusion of $ 1.2 billion in federal money for education , health care and law enforcement under President Clinton 's proposed 2001 budget , a White House aide said .",
            "Lynn Cutler , the president 's top adviser on Indian issues , said it 's the largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded programs in nearly all federal agencies .",
            "`` It 's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking about Indians and employing Indian people , '' Cutler said Tuesday , one day after she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and Eastern Tribes , which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas .",
            "Clinton announced the spending initiative in his State of the Union address last week , but did not mention any specifics .",
            "Those will be included in his 2001 budget proposal , to be announced next week .",
            "Among the spending Clinton will seek : $ 300 million to build at least six new reservation schools , a $ 117 million increase for reservation road repairs , about $ 300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $ 103 million added to reservation law enforcement , Cutler said .",
            "The head of the Interior Department 's Bureau of Indian Affairs , the main agency funding tribal governments , said the extra money is welcome but wo n't address all the problems .",

            "`` I might get in trouble for telling you that , but it 's not a direct translation , '' he said .",
            "McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time , long before they became news to the outside world .",
            "An accomplished carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont , McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to whaling and the sea .",
            "`` As I learned about our oral history , some of the songs and dances we do , my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and where we come from . ''",
            "The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called the Hummingbird .",
            "`` The songs keep your mind off the pain '' of paddling for hours , said Don Swan , a powerfully built man who , like McCarty , would like to be the `` chosen one '' to heft the harpoon .",
            "Neah Bay , like many other Native American communities , is struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent , deep poverty and the problems of crime , drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence .",
            "McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide inspiration and a new focus for the community .",
            "`` It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example , '' he said .",
            "Whaling `` involves so much concentration , so much preparation , that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle ( substance abuse or violence ) would have to drop it . ''",
            "On a rare sunny spring day , McCarty and seven other members of the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice .",
            "A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie Hunter trailed the canoe .",
            "Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr. sat near Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern .",
            "In the background , a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting , two-note tune .",
            "Eric would like to be a whaler someday .",
            "`` Yeah , I 'm thinking about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights , '' he said , becoming very serious .",
            "`` I think I would want to be the harpooner .",
            "If you 're the harpooner , you have to have a lot of strength so you can stick it in the whale . ''",
            "`` I really want to take after my ancestors , '' said Eric , one small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of unemployment or Jim Beam .",
            "Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came alongside .",
            "The men passed little Eric between boats .",
            "As he scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe , a luminous smile transformed his serious face .",
            "Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a .50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor .",
            "It will deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned , explained Johnson , hefting the weapon .",
            "The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by the Makah .",
            "The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick kill .",
            "Says McCarty : `` They want us to do a humane kill .",
            "That necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to the next world .",
            "I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a sacred way of life . ''",
            "But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the gun , but also of the hunt itself .",
            "`` What are we building our culture on by going after something we do n't want to eat ? ''",
            "she asked .",
            "That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly opposed the tribe 's return to whaling has been used by opponents of the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not representing the will of the people .",
            "But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American communities do not have a single , monolithic viewpoint any more than other communities .",
            "John McCarty also notes that in December 's tribal council election , two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson Jr. and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office .",
            "But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more than 70 years is a daunting challenge .",
            "So the Makah are turning for advice to other indigenous whalers .",
            "Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew traveled this winter to Barrow , Alaska , for the native whaling captains convention .",
            "They attended seminars on topics such as effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission .",
            "The tribe is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber , said Keith Johnson , president of the tribal whaling commission .",
            "The whaling crew members are also training together .",
            "They run together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they built behind Arnie Hunter 's trailer .",
            "The young men are learning to function as a team , said rifleman Wayne Johnson .",
            "The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice `` sneaking up and backing off '' whales , said McCarty .",
            "But many training methods will not be shared with the outside world .",
            "For example , beginning with the first day of a new moon , the nascent whalers will do a `` special type of training , '' said McCarty .",
            "`` Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown , '' said McCarty without offering further explanation .",
            "A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is the bridge it creates between generations .",
            "For example , John McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son Micah .",
            "`` In Makah Bay , they harpooned this whale , a big bull , '' said John McCarty , recounting the tale he heard from his father .",
            "`` He was big enough and strong enough that they could n't get close enough to give him another harpoon .",
            "He went straight out to sea ( dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether ) .",
            "`` It was one fierce ride .",
            "The whale was relentless ; the toughest whale they had ever seen .",
            "They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just a tiny bump .",
            "They gave up , cut him loose , lost their harpoon and floats .",
            "Fortunately , there was a west wind , so they set sail and headed home .",
            "The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the bottom of the canoe . ''",
            "It is the telling of such stories across the generations that defines the Makah .",
            "When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed when the men passed him into the whaling canoe , Keith Johnson said : `` These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth .",
            "How can we describe that to the world ? ''"

            "SYRACUSE , N.Y. ( AP ) - New York acted honorably in acquiring Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to protect the Iroquois tribe , a Canadian anthropologist testified Wednesday .",
            "After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied , bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre reservation , U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different historical perspective from the state 's first witness , Alexander von Gernet .",
            "McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act , which required Congressional approval for all Indian land transactions .",
            "Following a monthlong trial , a federal court jury in February awarded the Cayugas $ 36.9 million for their lost ancestral lands .",
            "The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to decide whether the jury 's award should be increased .",
            "It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to understand New York 's behavior dealing with Native Americans after that time , said von Gernet , a Native American expert from the University of Toronto .",
            "It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over Indian land transactions within its borders , von Gernet said .",
            "Historical documents show that as early as 1684 , the colonial governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes , he said .",
            "That policy was carried forward in other treaties , laws and proclamations enacted over the next century , von Gernet testified .",
            "It was a policy also included in the state constitution , he said .",
            "''Congress was a newfangled institution .",
            "Colonial New York had a longrunning relationship with the tribes , '' von Gernet said .",
            "''The idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in New York .",
            "It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary War . ''",
            "The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a conquered people and make them wards of the state , von Gernet said .",
            "However , then Gov .",
            "George Clinton ignored the warnings and instead decided to broker a treaty with them , von Gernet testified .",
            "Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership of Indian lands , the treaty also ensured reservation land would be set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land , he said .",
            "Von Gernet also testified : -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for 22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about buying their reservation land .",
            "-That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the Revolutionary War , leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each follow its own course .",
            "The Cayugas ' witnesses have testified that in agreeing to the 1795 treaty , New York knowingly ignored Iroquois tradition , which required the Grand Council 's consensus to make the treaty binding .",
            "Additionally , von Gernet said , following the war , the Cayugas split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position through achievement as opposed to inheriting them .",
            "''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in diplomatic discourse , '' von Gernet told McCurn .",
            "He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal by state lawmakers .",
            "The minority faction , led by Steel Trap , returned to the Cayuga Lake area , where faced with an onslaught of settlers , it eventually worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe 's lands to New York except for the 64,000-acre reservation ."

            "The relationship has n't been stress-free , tribal leaders say , but there has been marked improvement from 1990 , when Census officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American Indian population .",
            "The national undercount rate was 1.6 percent .",
            "For instance , on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation that sprawls across Arizona , New Mexico and Utah , about one in eight Navajos were not counted in 1990 .",
            "The tribe is determined not to let that happen again .",
            "''We 've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the Navajo nation has profound control over the count , by way of hiring our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate , and the maps for enumeration were created by Navajo chapters , '' said Mellor Willie , spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye .",
            "More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians governmental affairs director Jack Jackson , Jr. is that an estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on reservations were missed .",
            "Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps , and may have been unaware of tribal customs , Jackson said .",
            "The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos today .",
            "Willie said the Navajos missed out on $ 110 million in federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount .",
            "'' I do n't think a lot of Navajo people within the last census count knew this was helping in their communities , '' Willie said .",

            "''When we hire now , we want to hire people who live in their own communities to work in their own communities , and we have told Indian leaders in our communities that , '' said Beavers , himself an American Indian , who in his job works with tribes in Oklahoma and Minnesota .",
            "Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs , grants to local education agencies for Indian education , and family violence prevention and services .",

            "Rather , Powless , whose tribe opposes gambling , hopes that a settlement with the state of New York over ancient land claims will bring his brethren the assets they desperately need to upgrade their 7,300-acre reservation south of Syracuse .",
            "`` We have lived in this area for 1,200 years , '' said Powless , a robust man who recalls with pride when , a generation ago , he competed against football great Jim Brown in a lacrosse match and knocked the powerful All-American and Hall of Fame fullback off his feet .",

            "The Onondagas have n't yet gone to court to stake their land claim , but the nation is building a case against the state of New York that would follow suits filed by other Iroquois nations _ the Cayuga , Mohawk , Oneida and Seneca _ with the federal government as co-plaintiff .",

            "In the months since , 10 more tribes , some of them under threat of federal action , have signed the Pala compact , which limits each tribe to 199 of the new machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to other tribes , up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe , with a statewide cap of 19,900 .",
            "The State Legislature ratified the agreements in August .",
            "Most of the gaming tribes contend that Wilson , who is barred from seeking a third term this year , refused to negotiate in good faith , as required by the 1988 federal law .",
            "So Proposition 5 leaves little to chance , flatly requiring the state to grant a compact allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted them , though , as is now the case , the measure would only allow games in which players bet against a pool of other players ' money , not against the casino house itself , as in Las Vegas and Atlantic City .",
            "Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to protect Indian gambling , and to hammer home the point , they are now running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo , head of the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians , which signed the Pala compact and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of Sacramento .",

            "`` No tribe needs Prop .",
            "5 to operate casinos . ''",
            "For their part , supporters of the measure have accused their fellow tribes of being turncoats recruited by `` the big Nevada casinos , '' to oppose the proposition , in an echo of internecine betrayals of the past .",
            "At the San Manuel Casino , which draws 3,000 to 4,000 gamblers a day and where the card dealers now wear bold `` No on 5 '' T-shirts , players said they supported the measure .",
            "`` What 's going to happen to these people if Proposition 5 does n't go through ? ''",
            "asked Ruth Kennedy , a retired nurse who comes every day to play bingo and the slots from late afternoon until the wee hours of the morning , and who once won a $ 40,000 jackpot .",
            "`` Why is Vegas and them so upset with the Indian halls ?",
            "You ca n't tell me this place does n't do things for the community . ''",
            "In fact , according to Steven Lengel , the casino 's customer services director , it sponsors a range of school and community programs in Highland and the neighboring towns of San Bernardino and Redlands , and its uniformed security force of 250 is bigger than those of the three local cities combined .",
            "It sells no alcohol , allows none on the premises and employs more than 1,400 people , the vast majority of them local residents .",
            "But opponents of the measure , including the California Labor Federation AFL-CIO and the United Farm Workers , complain that it would exempt the Indian casinos from environmental and worker health and safety laws , and calls for distributing a maximum of 2 percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling machines to non-gaming tribes .",
