            "CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America .",
            "Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even more local : they are doing it themselves .",
            "The number of Americans teaching their own children has more than tripled since the beginning of the decade .",
            "Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at home at 1.23 million , or slightly more than all the public-school students in New Jersey .",
            "Such numbers are notoriously imprecise , since some of the most populous states , such as Texas and Illinois , collect no meaningful data on home schooling .",
            "Still , experts reckon that the number of families teaching their children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing by at least 15 percent a year .",
            "Why ?",
            "Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit , the natural complement to free love and natural healing .",
            "But the flower children soon had strange bedfellows .",
            "In the mid-1980s , home schooling was embraced by Christian fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and moral education .",
            "Recently , there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who are dissatisfied with public schools .",
            "The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the regular system .",
            "Two years ago , for the first time , dissatisfaction with the public schools was a more common answer than religious preference .",
            "According to Mary Anne Pitman , an educational anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati , one fast-growing group of home schoolers is black professionals , worried by the lack of safe , effective public schools for their children .",
            "Two decades ago , home schooling was illegal in many states and strongly discouraged in most others .",
            "Students were hunted down as truants ; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed .",
            "All 50 states now allow it , though the degree of regulation varies enormously .",
            "In Minnesota , home schoolers must register , check in regularly , and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are not falling behind .",
            "In Illinois , they are virtually unregulated .",
            "Some states have become downright accommodating .",
            "Washington and Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time basis if they ask for it .",
            "In California , children can enroll in an independent study program through a public school and then do their studying at home .",
            "Not surprisingly , the busiest opponents of all this are school administrators , particularly superintendents .",
            "They can be expected to have a belief in public schools , of course , but not all their concerns are so well-intentioned .",
            "In most states , schools are financed according to the number of pupils attending .",
            "`` Superintendents see every kid who does n't come in as a potential $ 6,000 loss , '' says Michael Farris , the president of the Home School Legal Defense Association ( HSLDA ) .",
            "The teachers ' unions are not fond of home schooling , either .",
            "The National Education Association handbook declares that `` home schooling programs can not provide the student with a comprehensive education experience . ''",
            "Yet the legal climate has changed , in large part , because home schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force .",
            "Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong Republican backing .",
            "They are also very good at bare-knuckle , grass-roots politics .",
            "The HSLDA has a staff of 50 , including seven lawyers , who lobby on Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level .",
            "When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their child at home without a teacher 's license , the HSLDA fought the case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court , where the law requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck down as unconstitutional .",
            "Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every congressional office within a matter of hours .",
            "At the same time , public opinion on home schooling has shifted .",
            "When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards education first asked about home schooling in 1985 , 73 percent of those surveyed said it was a bad thing , compared with 16 percent who approved .",
            "When the same question was asked in 1997 , the objectors had fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled , to 36 percent .",
            "Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep into mainstream magazines .",
            "Amazon.com , the biggest Internet bookseller , now lists over 200 books on the subject .",
            "But what happens to the children ?",
            "The HSLDA claims that , on average , home-schooled students outperform their public-school peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects , and that the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap grows .",
            "The figures may be tilted , and home-schooled students , whose parents are an exacting bunch , would probably do well in public schools too .",
            "Still , home schooling is not creating a generation of dullards .",
            "Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over the past two decades .",
            "`` Some of these kids are absolutely terrific .",
            "They 've done interesting things , '' says David Illingworth , the senior admissions officer .",
            "Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name , since many of its most successful students have taken some courses in public schools and even in community colleges .",
            "The picture of a mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not do justice to the idea , he says .",
            "And there is a harder question : is it possible to develop socially without ever going to school ?",
            "Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children and adults of varying ages rather than becoming `` peer-dependent . ''",
            "Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of other six-year-olds than she did about her own family .",
            "`` Real life , '' he says , `` does not consist of age-segregated herds . ''",
            "Harvard 's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones .",
            "The exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted .",
            "One shadow lies over home schooling .",
            "Joe Nathan , a senior fellow at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota , has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home .",
            "Most want to give their children a better education ; but a tiny minority are dangerously racist , angry or alienated .",
            "`` There are some real haters , '' says Nathan .",
            "In general , he considers home schooling to be a good thing for bringing change to the public schools ; many home schoolers have already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and other such experiments .",
            "But there is a worrying group lurking in the home-schooling shadows .",
            "Even so , most home-schooling parents choose to teach their children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon the public schools are missing the mark ; and , in many cases , they are right .",
            "A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the whole public system .",
            "Rather than merely talking of change , it is time to bring some about .",

            "The speaker 's roster of presidential candidates , including Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes , plus independent New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith , was testimony to the potency of education in this campaign and the growing appeal of home schooling among religious and political conservatives disenchanted with public schools .",
            "Since the association was founded in 1983 , when home schooling was not even legal in all 50 states as it is today , the number of children whose parents eschew schools for at-home lessons grew from a couple hundred to today 's estimate of 1.5 million to 1.7 million , said HSLDA spokesman Richard Jefferson .",
            "During a musical slide show between political speakers and prayer offerings , the audience -- sprinkled with baby strollers and slouched children in play clothes -- burst into applause when the screen flashed Patrick Henry 's immortal line , `` Give me liberty or give me death . ''",

            "DES MOINES , Iowa ( AP ) -- Republican presidential contender Gary Bauer said Tuesday that school voucher proposals should be expanded to cover the cost to parents of educating their children at home .",
            "Bauer noted that most school voucher proposals provide funds for moving children to private schools or public schools outside the home district but do n't include home schooling .",

            "Most of the debate is over whether tax money for public school students should be used for tuition at private schools .",

            "The organization estimates that 1.7 million American youngsters are now home schooled _ a number contested as too high by some _ and although the majority are thought to be white evangelical Christians with highly educated parents , Smith said his group is seeing rapid growth in home schooling among other religious groups , such as Muslims and Catholics .",
            "But for American Muslims _ an ethnically diverse and fast-growing group whose population is estimated to be 6 million to 7 million _ it is not yet clear whether home schooling will be a permanent part of the landscape or a temporary phenomenon until the community builds more private schools .",

            "There are other political connections , too : Janet Ashcroft , the wife of Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri , is on the school 's board of trustees .",
            "And Farris considers Representative Steve Largent , an influential Republican from Oklahoma , a `` good friend . ''",
            "Those political ties will become increasingly important if the apprenticeship system is put into practice , as some of the 100 to 140 students begin to write legislative papers for congressmen .",

            "PALO ALTO , Calif. _ Education reformers of conservative or libertarian stripe are already hanging crepe for the school voucher initiative on the California ballot next month .",
            "It will be a major blow to their movement nationally if voters in the most populous state reject , for the second time in less than 10 years , the idea of giving public money to parents to help students escape public schools .",
            "Vouchers are an intellectually interesting but largely untested article of faith for many in the camp that correctly diagnoses the poor state of public education but then often fixates on teachers unions , vehement opponents of vouchers , as the taproot of a problem that has far more diverse causes .",
            "The California initiative , Proposition 38 , would give parents $ 4,000 for every school-age child that could be spent for any form of currently sanctioned education _ including parochial , secular private , charter school , home schooling .",
            "It 's the brainchild of high-tech venture capitalist Tim Draper , a guy with more money than political skill .",
            "Draper unwisely rejected pleas of some voucher supporters to target the proposal for the poor or on demonstrably wretched schools ( which are virtually one and the same thing ) .",
            "He also did not seek to insulate the measure from criticism that helped doom a similar California initiative in 1993 , especially a lack of rules to guarantee equity and access in private education .",
            "Draper has pledged to spend up to $ 20 million on the campaign .",
            "And with the issue tanking , he has offered Hawaiian vacations , computers and shopping sprees to folks who 'll sign up supporters .",
            "But it seems a lost cause , Stanford political scientist _ and voucher supporter _ Terry Moe told a Hoover Institution seminar staffed by what the professor called `` a small band of nonconformists . ''",
            "`` Who is supporting this ?",
            "No one , '' Moe said .",
            "`` It 's a bump along the road that did n't have to be there . ''",

            "38 _ a near-fatal standing for a ballot initiative a month before an election .",
            "The PPIC analysis is that the measure `` faces an uphill battle in large part because it is not viewed as a solution to improving schools or student performance . ''",
            "A similar fate may await a voucher initiative next month in Michigan , where even Republican Gov .",
            "John Engler opposes the proposal , which at heart is a repeal of the state 's constitutional ban on public aid to private schools .",
            "The Michigan plan would provide just over $ 3,000 of state money per child in districts that graduate less than two-thirds of their students _ a formula that would include the giant ( and egregiously problem-ridden ) Detroit system and about 30 others statewide .",
            "Among the initiative 's biggest backers is the self-interested Roman Catholic Church , operator of the state 's largest private school system .",
            "Model sermons are being drafted for pre-election exhortations .",
            "The National Education Association , the nation 's largest teachers union , is , as usual , playing tough .",
            "At its national convention in July , the NEA instituted a & QL ; $ 5-a-member assessment to fight voucher programs , $ 3 of which ( or some $ 6 million ) is earmarked for the `` no '' campaigns in California and Michigan .",
            "Only about 50,000 students are in voucher programs , meaning suggestions of success are anecdotal at best and provide far too sketchy findings on which to base wholesale changes in the nation 's education system , even as troubled as it admittedly is .",
            "Given vouchers ' political baggage and the prospect of approaching bad luck at the polls , it seems that incremental advances with smaller , experimental programs , for vouchers as well as other proposals , would be a better way to go .",
            "But that suggestion from the Hoover audience drew what seemed to be an unappreciative sneer from some of the crusading `` nonconformists . ''",
            "Chester Finn , a Vanderbilt professor and Manhattan Institute fellow who was a Reagan administration Education Department official , said that reaching for something bold and extreme sometimes allows the merely interesting to bubble up .",

            "This , even as they are accused of abandoning the very public school system that for decades minorities who fought to overcome separate and unequal education have been told is the ticket up and out of oppression .",

            "Single parents are venturing into it , and it is proving to be a sanctuary for many interracial couples .",
            "In the past , homeschooling has been a choice made mostly by white , middle-income families who could afford setting themselves apart from the traditional educational system .",

            "`` I think over the next five years , you 're going to see real growth , '' he said .",
            "The rapid expansion and growth in use of the Internet also has meant plenty of inexpensive resources for homeschoolers , easing some socioeconomic barriers .",
            "A book written in 1996 , `` Freedom Challenge : African American Homeschoolers , '' even features essays by 15 families that serve as a road map .",
            "The interest in homeschooling is growing so much that Joyce and Eric Burges of Baker , La. , are creating a national networking group that encourages African-Americans to homeschool .",
            "`` My husband and I want to put a beacon of light out there that says this is an option , this is a choice you have , '' said Joyce Burges , an executive secretary who homeschools three children .",

            "`` It 's a matter of commitment , '' said Missy Parker , a Southern Baptist who homeschools to teach religious values .",
            "She estimates that at least 200 African-American families in Detroit are homeschooling .",
            "`` Most African-Americans would n't venture to do it because they did n't feel they were equipped .",
            "But , that 's what the support group is for , so you do n't have to do it on your own . ''",
            "Homeschooling , however , does n't come without challenges or criticisms as any family , black or white , knows .",
            "These include fear of the unknown , lack of support from relatives and friends , financial belt-tightening and questions about the legitimacy of homeschooling .",

            "Results by race on the 1999 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System showed black and Latino students behind whites in every category for every grade .",
            "In contrast , the Shaws point to a 1997 study by Ray and the Home School Legal Defense Association showing less of a disparity between achievement rates in math and reading among minority and white homeschoolers .",

            "During a recent homeschooling session , one of Brook 's white friends and Kristoff had a complex conversation on how black people are sometimes portrayed negatively in cartoons .",

            "Here , he was placed in kindergarten and put in a corner to play with blocks , she said .",
            "`` He became so distracted and disinterested in school , '' she said , and watched as he was bused out of his community to a school with special needs students , and told her son might have attention deficit disorder .",
