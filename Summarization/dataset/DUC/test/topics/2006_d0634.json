            "OTTAWA , June 3 ( Xinhua ) -- Canada and the United States announced here Thursday that they have reached an agreement on the elements of a ten-year accord to conserve and manage Pacific salmon .",
            "The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term viability of their salmon industries , said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Alberight in a joint statement issued here Thursday .",
            "The comprehensive agreement , reached through vigorous diplomacy among the responsible parties , is designed to ensure the sustentation of the five Pacific salmon species through a combination of scientific co-operation , in addition to providing new funds to improve fisheries management and aid recovery of weakened salmon stocks .",
            "The agreement is also necessary to limit on salmon catches , said the joint statement .",
            "Under the accord , the U.S. will provide 142 million U.S. dollars to a conservation fund to help rebuild stocks and habitat on both sides of the border .",
            "It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the future , said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson .",
            "The U.S. catch of Fraser River salmon will be limited under 16 .",
            "5 percent , down from an historical average of about 20 percent , while U.S. fishermen took 25 percent last year .",
            "The Pacific Salmon treaty was first negotiated in 1985 to divide the salmon catch between U.S. and Canadian fishermen based on how many fish were spawned in each country .",
            "However , sections that dictated how to do that expired in 1992 .",
            "Since then , there have been a series of failed and sometimes hostile negotiations for a new agreement ."

            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- A permanent conservation fund that President Clinton will propose Monday includes $ 100 million for initiatives to preserve salmon in four West Coast states , officials said .",
            "If Clinton gets his way , the money to save salmon in Alaska , Washington , Oregon and California would be replenished automatically at $ 100 million each year for at least a decade .",
            "The money would go to the states annually without approval from Congress -- if Congress agrees to enact Clinton 's `` Lands Legacy '' program into law this year .",
            "`` The fact that we 've come back and asked for the full $ 100 million , and this year proposed in addition that it be made permanent , shows how serious we are about making this a priority , '' said George Frampton , chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality .",
            "In all , Clinton is proposing $ 290 million for salmon conservation programs in the West and Pacific Northwest .",
            "That includes $ 91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Columbia-Snake river system ; $ 60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada ; and $ 39 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service 's salmon recovery efforts .",
            "The proposals represent increases of 30 percent or more over what Congress approved last year for salmon .",
            "Salmon are a cultural icon on the Pacific Northwest and have been suffering for decades from dams , development , overfishing , runoff and other problems .",
            "In Washington , Oregon , Idaho and California , 26 salmon populations are threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act .",
            "Clinton first proposed the $ 100 million to help rebuild coastal salmon stocks a year ago , but Congress approved just $ 58 million for the effort .",
            "Frampton declined to discuss other details of the `` Lands Legacy '' proposal until the administration reveals its fiscal 2001 budget on Monday .",
            "But he said the program will use off-shore oil drilling royalties and other revenues to create a permanent , dedicated fund for environmental preservation .",
            "The House Resources Committee last November approved a bill that is similar to what the administration is proposing .",
            "The measure would set aside more than 60 percent of off-shore oil drilling revenues for buying land and conserving coastline .",
            "But that measure , which is pending on the House floor , did not single out salmon for funding ."

            "OTTAWA , March 12 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. refusal to honor the Pacific Salmon Treaty is costing Canadian fishermen at least 60 million dollars ( 42 million U.S. dollars ) a year , said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson .",
            "The U.S. overfishing undermined Canadian efforts to save the salmon from extinction , the minister was quoted by Thursday 's Globe and Mail newspaper as saying .",
            "`` Americans are taking more of our fish than we are taking of theirs , and the trend is upward , '' Anderson said in a speech on the eve of a long-delayed resumption of talks on salmon quotas .",
            "Ottawa and Washington announced Tuesday that the talks will begin at the end of this month , three months after two special envoys urged immediate return to negotiations .",
            "The envoys also asked the Alaskan fishermen to reduce their interception of Canadian-bound fish in the North Pacific .",
            "Under the 1985 treaty , neither country is supposed to take more fish from the ocean than the number that originates in their waters .",
            "Yet , Alaskan interceptions of fish returning to Canadian rivers last year reached an unprecedented peak , even while Canada was cutting its own catch to save them from extinction , Anderson noted .",

            "Gary Locke and Canada 's fisheries minister , David Anderson , say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries dispute up and down the Pacific Coast .",
            "`` If we can not deal with problems on this coast , what hope is there for dealing with the crisis of overfishing worldwide ? ''",
            "Anderson asked Thursday in a Seattle speech to the World Affairs Council .",
            "He echoed the optimism of Vice President Al Gore , who said in a February interview that the United States will make a major push this year to reach a long-term fisheries agreement with Canada .",
            "And Locke , encouraged by results of interim accords , said : `` It is time to come to a long-term U.S.-Canada agreement that focuses on recovery of salmon in all of our rivers . ''",
            "Anderson and Locke celebrated a trio of two-way deals that have made an immediate , positive impact on several of the Northwest 's most imperiled salmon runs .",
            "Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia , and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound for the Stuart River .",
            "In turn , the Canadians cut back ocean fishing off Vancouver Island for Puget Sound-bound chinook and coho salmon .",
            "The result has been much higher numbers of adult spawning salmon _ particularly imperiled spring chinook salmon in the region .",
            "`` We successfully concentrated on finding a solution rather than apportioning the blame , '' Locke said .",
            "Locke and leaders of local governments in the region face a big challenge in the recent listing of Puget Sound-area salmon under the Endangered Species Act .",
            "The listing is likely to require multiple measures to improve spawning habitat .",
            "But , Anderson maintained , money done to nurture salmon in streams will be wasted drain unless conservation measures are taken at sea .",
            "`` The other half of the equation is to get adult salmon back from the Pacific Ocean to their spawning beds , '' said Anderson , a longtime conservationist who represents Victoria in Canada 's House of Commons .",
            "Over the past five years , the fishing dispute has repeatedly disrupted U.S.-Canadian relations .",
            "In 1994 , Canada 's fisheries ministry slapped a $ 1,100 `` licensing fee '' on Alaska-bound U.S. fishing boats using waters of British Columbia 's Inside Passage .",
            "Two years ago , British Columbia Premier Glen Clark tried to have U.S. submarines barred from a torpedo testing range on Vancouver Island .",
            "In the summer of 1997 a blockade by B.C .",
            "fishing boats prevented the Alaska Ferry `` Malaspina '' from leaving the dock in Prince Rupert .",
            "However , the past year has seen a major change of policy and attitude in Canada .",
            "Instead of hammering at historic inequities in the salmon catch _ U.S.-fishermen catch millions of salmon bound for Canadian rivers _ Anderson has put heavy emphasis on conservation .",
            "He moved last year to curtail fishing of coho salmon .",
            "Instead of the two-five million coho salmon caught annually by B.C .",
            "commercial fishermen in the mid-1990s , only 100,000 coho were caught by all fisheries _ commercial , sport and native _ in 1998 .",
            "`` Confrontation makes everyone poorer , '' Anderson said Thursday .",
            "`` Our constituencies are tired of arguments over who would kill the last fish . ''",
            "Anderson 's policy has met with opposition from the British Columbia government and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union .",
            "But his strategy has proven as popular a cause in British Columbia as the restoration of salmon is south of the border .",
            "`` Salmon are a totem of this part of the world , '' he said .",

            "Soon the California Legislature will decide whether to appropriate $ 130 million for purchase of 7,500 acres of redwoods in Humboldt County .",
            "With an additional $ 250 million in federal money , the purchase price of these majestic trees is $ 380 million .",
            "In my view , the 7,500 acres of virgin and second-growth redwoods are not by themselves worth $ 380 million .",
            "This huge expenditure is justified only if the public can be assured that the side agreement _ a giant string attached to the purchase , known as a `` habitat conservation plan '' _ wo n't imperil the future of endangered species on the rest of Pacific Lumber 's 200,000 acres nearby .",
            "As it stands now , the habitat conservation plan negotiated by Pacific Lumber and government officials would not only permit the logging of ancient redwoods .",
            "It could also lead to extinction of the coho salmon population in California .",

            "Contrary to the `` 50-year protection '' allegedly locked in for these groves , Pacific Lumber is negotiating a separate side agreement with federal wildlife officials that would allow the company to seek changes to the habitat plan periodically for the purpose of logging one or more of these groves .",
            "The coho salmon to be affected by the Headwaters habitat plan now amount to just 1 percent of their original numbers .",
            "In 1973 , there were 40,000 fishing jobs on the North Coast .",
            "Now there are just 5,000 .",
            "Those jobs disappeared after logging and mining destroyed the coho salmon 's habitat .",
            "Under the proposed Headwaters habitat plan , Pacific Lumber would establish a 30-foot `` no-cut '' zone on the sides of streams to protect spawning habitat for coho salmon .",
            "Yet two of the U.S. Forest Service 's top coho salmon experts _ geologist Leslie Reid and hydrologist Robert Ziemer _ have asserted that the `` no-cut '' buffer zones are inadequate .",
            "The scientists noted `` significant discrepancy '' between the protections in the Headwaters habitat conservation plan and the two most widely accepted , scientifically based sources , which recommend `` no-cut '' zones of 170 to 300 feet .",
            "To date , officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service , the agency responsible for survival of the coho salmon , have been unable to rationalize the inconsistency between the previously recommended national standards of 170- to 300-foot `` no-cut '' zones and the Headwaters plan , which requires only 30 feet .",
            "To be sure , politics is the art of compromise .",
            "Wildlife biology , however , is not .",
            "If we compromise the habitat of the coho salmon for Pacific Lumber , we will be forced to do so for other private landowners up and down the coast .",
            "Although the struggle for Headwaters Forest has already gone on for more than 15 years , we must remember that extinction is forever .",

            "WASHINGTON ( AP -- Rising ocean temperatures , perhaps caused by global climate change , are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat , two marine biologist said today , citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon .",
            "`` Whether the changes are related to global warming is not statistically clear , but it 's what appears to be happening , '' said Jim Barry , a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California .",
            "The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon .",
            "It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds , they said .",
            "`` We do n't fully realize what 's happening ... but these are the sort of events we expect from global warming , '' said David Welch , head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National Department of Fisheries .",
            "Welch , who is based in British Columbia , said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of `` large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem . ''",
            "While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer , the reasons remain in dispute .",
            "Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution , but others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes , including the El Nino phenomenon .",
            "Whatever the reason , higher ocean temperatures already have had dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries , the two biologists said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute .",
            "Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in Alaska 's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year .",
            "Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past , he said .",
            "And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997 , he said .",
            "Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the warmer ocean waters that , he said , sapped the salmon of their energy and strength .",
            "`` We 're starting to see a very troubling perspective on this , '' he said .",
            "The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to the equator , causing changes in the food chain .",
            "The reduced size of returning salmon and the decrease in overall numbers `` suggests large-scale starvation , '' they said .",
            "Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change , the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea , abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat .",
            "While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future , `` the early stages are already here , '' he argued .",
            "As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical , Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased , suggesting a broader climate change .",

            "Keeping the predators away is vital , as can be seen elsewhere on the Columbia River .",
            "Birds and predator fish below Bonneville Dam have devoured more than 20 percent of the young salmon emerging from the outfall of the dam 's second powerhouse .",
            "South of Wenatchee , at Rock Island Dam , most young salmon go safely down the dam 's spillways .",

            "The agreement also calls for a $ 140 million fund that would be used to buy up fishing licenses _ essentially paying some fishermen not to fish _ and to begin restoration efforts in rivers whose spawning areas have been damaged .",

            "SEATTLE _ Lending political momentum to an idea that would have been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history , Gov .",
            "John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored breaching four large federal dams on Washington state 's Snake River in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations .",
            "Kitzhaber , a Democrat , became the first major political figure to endorse the controversial dam-removal proposal , which is passionately favored by many environmental groups , American Indians and commercial fishermen , but opposed with equal fervor by farmers and many others in the interior Northwest who now rely on the tamed Snake River for barge shipping and electricity .",
            "The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress , sometime after the Army Corps of Engineers , which operates the dams , issues its own opinion on the proposal next year .",
            "Just how much influence Kitzhaber 's stand will have remains to be seen , but it is nonetheless an intriguing reflection of changing times in man 's relationship with the rivers of the Northwest , where some hydroelectric dams generate enormous amounts of power but have also proven lethal on a major scale to the region 's fabled salmon runs .",
            "`` In the end , the answer will be a political one _ informed by good science _ but based on a set of values and on the degree of economic and ecological risks the region is willing to accept , '' Kitzhaber said in a speech to the American Fisheries Society in Eugene , Ore. `` It is time that we shoulder our responsibilities and develop a blueprint for action . ''",
            "Construction of Northwest dams was an undeniably epic engineering achievement , celebrated in Woody Guthrie 's songs more than a half-century ago .",
            "But for the last several decades , the Corps of Engineers has been laboring under federal requirements , to help dams and the salmon coexist on the Snake but has met little success .",
            "Despite spending more than $ 3 billion on projects such as fish ladders , hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging system that a Corps brochure describes as `` custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible '' for the fish , the salmon populations have declined .",
            "The Snake 's coho salmon has already been declared extinct , and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act .",
            "In the early 1800s , when the explorer William Clark discovered a river `` crouded with salmon , '' about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip back to their spawning grounds , biologists estimate .",
            "( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM ) Ed Bowles , Idaho 's manager of anadromous fish , those that hatch in fresh water and migrate to the sea , said today that 3,276 Snake River adult spring and summer chinook returned last year , down from 8,426 in 1998 .",
            "Fall chinook returns were estimated to be about 400 , slightly up from 306 in 1998 .",
            "( END OPTIONAL TRIM ) Under the dam-breaching proposal now being considered by the Corps , earth around the dams would be removed , rendering the dams themselves inoperative and restoring 140 miles of the Snake River in eastern Washington to a wild , free-flowing condition .",
            "Many scientists and biologists have endorsed dam breaching as the step that would have the greatest odds of saving the salmon from extinction .",
            "The dams _ Ice Harbor , Lower Monumental , Little Goose and Lower Granite _ would be the biggest federal dams ever slated for removal .",
            "But there is no guarantee that the plan would work , and it would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the Pacific Northwest 's electricity .",
            "( Unlike other dams in the region , the Snake dams are not used for flood control . )",
            "The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston , Idaho , in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean , into the West 's most inland seaport .",
            "But virtually all barge traffic to and from Lewiston would stop if the dams were breached .",
            "Lawmakers in eastern Washington have lined up against any breaching .",
            "Republican lawmakers throughout the region have been generally united against the idea .",
            "U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton , R-Wash. , who is running for re-election this year , said taking down the dams would be `` an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare '' for the region .",
            "Many Democrats have been non-commital on the idea , but Kitzhaber , who said Friday that the region should feel shame for losing what were `` once the greatest salmon runs on the face of the earth , '' has now become the first major political figure from the region to endorse breaching .",
            "( STORY CAN END HERE .",
            "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) In his speech Friday , Kitzhaber said that the region is required to try to save the fish under the federal Endangered Species Act , and he warned that if dam-breaching were not attempted , other alternatives might be even more expensive and disruptive .",
            "`` All I am saying to you today is that we have to stop deluding ourselves into believing that our choices will be easier and cheaper if we just leave the dams alone , '' he said .",
            "`` Our choices wo n't be easier .",
            "They 'll be just as tough . ''",
            "Kitzhaber , who was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998 , also criticized , by implication , a range of state and federal officials who have called for more study of the issue .",
            "`` Some will say that we have not done enough science , '' said Kitzhaber .",
            "`` I say that we can always play that card as an excuse for inaction and as a justification for avoiding tough choices .",
            "But exactly what additional scientific experiment is necessary to demonstrate that it is easier for salmon to migrate in a free-flowing river than to negotiate a several hundred foot high concrete barrier ? ''",
            "Environmentalists praised Kitzhaber .",
            "`` The governor is providing what the Snake River salmon need most right now , and that is political leadership , '' said Rob Masonis , regional director of dam programs for American Rivers , a group that favors dam removal on many of the nation 's rivers ."
