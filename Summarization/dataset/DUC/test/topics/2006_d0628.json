            "Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder , a problem that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US schoolchildren , scientists say ..",
            "It could be a first step toward a long-sought objective test for ADHD , say researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital .",
            "Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD .",
            "In addition , it could reveal whether there are different forms of ADHD that respond better or worse to specific drugs .",
            "`` It is an interesting , promising , beginning , '' said Dr. Edward Hallowell , a psychiatrist and author of `` Driven to Distraction , '' a book about ADHD .",
            "He was not involved in the study .",
            "A test would be welcome , he said , `` because now it 's based on the person 's history and psychological testing , so there 's an element of ambiguity '' about the diagnosis .",
            "People with ADHD tend to be overly active , distractible , unfocused , and impulsive , and as a result have a difficult time in school , social life and careers .",
            "Previously suspected causes such as family surroundings , diet and allergies have largely been discarded as mounting evidence implicates brain abnormalities probably due to altered genes , said Russell A. Barkley , an ADHD researcher in the psychology and psychiatry departments of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center .",
            "The brain scanning experiment found a chemical imbalance , which had been previously suspected , in a part of the brain that uses the nerve messenger dopamine .",
            "Dopamine helps regulate attention and inhibits impulsive behavior .",
            "Six adult patients who had been diagnosed with ADHD with standard tests had on average 70 percent more of a protein called the dopamine transporter than did a group of 30 normal volunteers , said the researchers .",
            "`` I think it 's very exciting , '' said Dr. Thomas Spencer , an MGH researcher and an author of the study .",
            "`` It was stunning that a problem in their brain corresponded to their symptoms '' in all six ADHD patients .",
            "A report on the study will be published Saturday as a letter in the British journal Lancet .",
            "In the brief article , the Massachusetts researchers described injecting patients with a radioactively tagged chemical agent called Altropane , which accumulated in dramatically higher levels in a particular part of the dopamine system in the brains of the ADHD patients .",
            "The disorder varies a great deal among people , so the new method will have to prove itself able to diagnose a wide range of ADHD types , and also needs confirmation in children , the researchers cautioned .",
            "`` This is certainly not yet a diagnostic test '' because it involved a `` very refined sample '' of ADHD patients who are n't representative of the entire spectrum of those who have it , said Barkley .",
            "But if confirmed , he added , the test could help answer skeptics who question whether ADHD is a real disorder , and not just a poorly defined label placed on very active , normally rebellious chldren .",
            "Barkley noted , though , that gene tests for ADHD may arrive at the same time or even more quickly than the scanning test .",
            "Part of the research being described in the Lancet report was supported by Boston Life Sciences , Inc. , which says it intends to develop Altropane as an ADHD test .",
            "It has already made a test using Altropane to detect early signs of Parkinson disease , the degenerative brain disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing nerve cells that leads to movement and gait disabilities .",
            "Altropane , said Dr. Alan J. Fischman , an MGH nuclear medicine specialist and senior author of the study , is a synthetic analogue of cocaine .",
            "Its molecules bind very tightly to molecules in the brain known as dopamine transporters , which regulate the amount of dopamine in certain parts of the brain .",
            "( People injected with Altropane for the imaging tests do n't feel any cocaine-like effects because the amount is so small , Fischman said . )",
            "Altropane was designed by Bertha K. Madras of Harvard 's New England Regional Primate Center in Southboro , Mass. , who first had the idea of measuring the dopamine transporter in Parkinson disease and ADHD .",
            "`` The idea came from a study I had done in the 1980s showing that Ritalin targets the dopamine transporter '' and binds to it tightly , said Madras .",
            "She suggested that the dopamine transporter might be a key player in ADHD , and if so , measuring the amount of the molecules could serve as a test .",
            "After showing that Altropane homed in on different dopamine structures in Parkinson disease and was developed as a test for it , the researchers , in an alliance with Boston Life Sciences , turned to ADHD .",
            "The experimental test required the volunteers to have Altropane injected intravenously .",
            "As it flowed through the brain , Altropane accumulated in the dopamine transporter molecules of the patients with ADHD and the difference between them and the normal patients was detected with an instrument known as a SPECT scanner .",
            "It took 30 to 45 minutes for the instrument to make the measurement .",
            "The researchers are in the process of designing larger studies , probably involving hundreds of patients , to determine how reliable and accurate the method will prove to be .",
            "Testing the Altropane technique on children can come only after ethics review boards are convinced that it is safe , said the scientists ."

            "CHICAGO ( AP ) -- The nation 's pediatricians are being asked to take an active role in diagnosing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder amid concern that merely rambunctious children are being given unnecessary medication .",
            "The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD , hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need .",
            "The guidelines are for children 6 through 12 .",
            "Most ADHD research has involved that age group , and the academy also said it recognizes that some symptoms can be chalked up to normal rambunctiousness and contrariness in preschoolers .",
            "However , recent research shows dramatic increases in the use of drugs like Ritalin to treat children with ADHD , suggesting the disorder is either becoming more common or is being overdiagnosed .",
            "The academy , the nation 's largest group of pediatricians , said it is unclear whether the disorder is being overdiagnosed , because doctors ' definitions and treatment of it varies widely .",
            "The academy said it believes the new guidelines will standardize the diagnosis and make it easier to identify which children really need help .",
            "Guidelines for treating ADHD are still being developed .",
            "''We 'd like to help us all ( diagnose ) more accurately , '' said Dr. James Perrin , an author of the guidelines and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School .",
            "Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- or an average of about 2.5 million , most of them boys -- are believed to have ADHD .",
            "Symptoms include short attention span , impulsive behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still .",
            "Ritalin is often prescribed to increase a child 's alertness .",
            "But many experts have pointed out that its long-term effects on children are unknown .",
            "For a diagnosis of ADHD under the new guidelines , a child must exhibit symptoms in at least two settings , such as at home and at school .",
            "The symptoms must harm the child 's academic or social functioning for at least six months .",
            "This is the first time the academy has drawn up guidelines for a behavioral ailment .",
            "The academy began developing them three years ago , said Dr. Martin Stein , co-author and a pediatrics professor at the University of California at San Diego .",
            "The guidelines also suggest that pediatricians and family doctors take a leading role in addressing the disorder , with information about the child 's behavior from parents and teachers .",
            "Doctors also should use criteria from the American Psychiatric Association 's diagnostic manual of mental disorders .",
            "Involving pediatricians in the diagnosis of ADHD is `` really exciting because they 're seeing these kids more than child psychiatrists , '' said Dr. Karen Pierce , a child psychiatrist in Chicago who helped develop the standards .",

            "The test suggests that parents of children suspected of having the learning and behavioral problem may someday be able to have their children tested before deciding whether to have them take potent and controversial drugs such as Ritalin and other stimulants .",
            "But Bertha Madras , one of the Harvard Medical School researchers who performed the initial test , said many more experiments must be performed before such a test is available .",
            "`` The initial data is robust , '' she said Thursday in a telephone interview , `` but a cascade of experiments have to be done before we can say we have a diagnostic tool . ''",
            "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a common psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5 percent of children in the United States .",
            "In general , it affects such functions as working memory , self-control and motivation .",
            "Madras , a professor of biopsychology at the medical school , said the test showed that the seven adults diagnosed with attention deficit disorder had on average a 70 percent elevation in concentrations of a brain protein called the dopamine transporter .",
            "By linking a radioactive iodine molecule to a substance that locks onto the dopamine transporter , the researchers were able to use imaging instruments to directly measure the concentrations of transporter .",
            "The study is described in a report being published Friday in the British medical journal , the Lancet .",
            "The finding appears to confirm theories about the way ADHD affects its victims , but Madras said tests on larger populations of adults and later on children must be performed .",

            "Most girls with ADHD have a form known as Type A , which is characterized primarily by inattentiveness and distractibility , and less by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior .",
            "The most common form among boys is known as Type B .",
            "Rather than flightiness , persons with this form tend to be hyperactive and impulsive .",
            "A Type C involves symptoms of both Types A and B .",
            "And Type D patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life , but none that clearly fit the other three forms .",
            "Studies have shown that academic performance of 90 percent of the school-age patients improves with stimulant medication , principally the drug methylphenidate , marketed as Ritalin .",
            "However , the treatment is controversial , since methylphenidate shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is addictive to test animals .",
            "It also is one of the most commonly diverted and stolen substances in America , and more high school students are reported to abuse it than receive it under prescription .",
            "Moreover , the diagnosis of ADHD is based on behavioral studies and can involve often-subjective judgements on the part of therapists .",
            "A consensus development panel convened last year by the National Institutes of Health recommended continued use of stimulant drugs for ADHD , but also called for more research toward understanding the nature of the disease and developing a more precise diagnostic procedures .",
            "Although the chemical reasons for ADHD are not clearly understood , scientists have speculated that the brain 's failure to control the activity of dopamine , a neurotransmitter that relays signals between nerve cells , is involved .",
            "Specifically , some researchers believe the transporter protein _ the `` truck '' that moves dopamine from one cell to the next _ is key to the condition .",
            "Normally , the transporter protein gathers up the dopamine after it has stimulated its target cells and returns it to the cells that released it .",
            "Methyphenidate , cocaine and other stimulant drugs are known to inhibit the transporter protein .",
            "By taking the `` trucks '' off the highway , the drugs cause dopamine to build up and continue to stimulate its targeted nerve cells , Madras explained .",
            "This has the paradoxical effect of calming persons with ADHD .",
            "Some researchers think this is because their condition stems from a deficiency of target cells or of the cell receptors that react with dopamine .",

            "A study by Dr. Julie Magno Zito at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore found that as many as 1.5 percent of American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking stimulants such as Ritalin , as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics .",
            "According to Zito 's findings , stimulant use in this age group ( Ritalin in 90 percent of the cases ) rose two- to threefold from 1991 to 1995 , while the rate of antidepressant prescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period .",
            "As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric problems , the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem , especially in younger age groups , says Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz , vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in New York City .",
            "`` We have a critical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of these medications in children , '' he says .",
            "Dr. Jerry Rushton , a pediatrician at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor , says that clinicians simply know more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past _ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of diagnoses and prescriptions .",
            "According to Rushton , heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s , which provided evidence that identifiable , biologically-based mental illnesses , such as depression , can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old .",
            "Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions , says Rushton , is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , including Prozac , Zoloft and Paxil , which have fewer , less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants .",
            "They have been increasingly prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating depression , obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children .",

            "A case in point is ADHD , which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 .",
            "In 1987 , the APA redefined the criteria for diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior , and not necessarily both , as was previously the case .",
            "The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD diagnoses .",
            "Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4 percent to 12 percent of all American children _ some 2.5 million _ are now thought to have the disorder , making it the most common pediatric mental illness in the United States .",
            "And according to Zito , the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD .",
            "Parents who consult a professional about their child 's behavior will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental health coverage is concerned .",
            "`` There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness , managed care interferes with diagnosis , '' says Dr. Alan Wachtel , a clinical associate professor at New York University Medical Center in New York City and author of `` The Attention Deficit Disorder Answer Book . ''",
            "Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists , limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions .",
            "And , according to Koplewicz , most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists , but by pediatricians , many of whom have little training in mental health .",
            "By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals , managed care companies are limiting the resources available to pediatricians , he says , which may add pressure to reach for the prescription pad .",
            "Experts , including Koplewicz , say that children with mental illness who do n't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others , and are at a much higher risk of delinquency , occupational problems and suicide later on in life .",
            "If you are worried that your pediatrician can not devote the time needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because of an overwhelming schedule , ask for a recommendation to a qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment , which should include in-depth interviews with the child , parents and teachers , and a review of school records and family history .",
            "Unfortunately , many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed care places on physicians , says Dr. Peter Jensen , the director of the Center for the Advancement of Children 's Mental Health at the Columbia University School of Medicine in New York City .",
            "But , he says , the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of the child 's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the child .",
            "In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted , a team of researchers at six sites around the country , led by Jensen , followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment .",
            "The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone .",
            "In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD , such as depression or anxiety , combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage .",
            "Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving .",
            "Because so few of these studies have been completed , a consensus among experts on the benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to emerge .",
            "Ultimately , parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child , says Koplewicz .",
            "After the evaluation , he says , `` the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis , as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration . ''",

            "The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View , Calif. 's Alza Corp. , which can now enter the $ 700 million-a-year market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder .",
            "ADHD makes it difficult for children to concentrate in class and in many instances makes them hyperactive and unruly .",

            "For the 3 to 5 percent of schoolchildren , mainly boys , who are believed to have ADHD , pediatricians routinely prescribe Ritalin or generic alternatives two or three times a day , generally around mealtimes .",
            "Although Novartis , the Swiss drug firm that invented Ritalin , brought out a sustained-release version in 1984 , that single-dose pill has not been widely used by physicians .",
            "Dr. Ami Goodman , a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco , said doctors typically prescribe the multiple-dose versions because they think they work better .",
            "Goodman said doctors have been hoping for an effective one-a-day version because fewer children will forget to take the drug .",

            "It depends on who 's describing it .",
            "But sales of the pill , the stimulant methylphenidate , which is marketed under the trade name Ritalin , have more than doubled in the past decade as more and more parents , teachers and therapists turn to the drug to treat a condition known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .",
            "While the drug , which acts on the brain in much the same way as cocaine , is increasingly used to make better students out of elementary school children deemed to have `` developmental disorders , '' a growing number of specialists has begun to question the wisdom of using the drug .",

            "People with behavioral patterns that cause them to be diagnosed as having ADHD _ impulsiveness , inability to concentrate , difficulty learning _ appear to have a deficiency in certain brain receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine , according to this view .",
            "Like cocaine , methylphenidate inhibits a brain chemical that removes dopamine from certain areas of the brain .",
            "In effect , it increases the time the reduced number of receptors is exposed to dopamine .",
            "But that may not be as simple as it sounds .",

            "On the flip side is the possibility raised by Ritalin 's many defendants - that millions of children are part of the first generation of humans to have a medicine that allows them to focus and succeed , both in the classroom and the schoolyard , the microcosms of the professional world and society .",

            "My strengths are abstract verbal reasoning , but it is extremely difficult for me to do the initial processing of written language . ''",
            "He says ADD is misnamed because it 's not an attention disorder but rather a control disorder , in which the part of the brain that organizes and plans is n't working .",
            "He says his medication combined with self-awareness and awareness on the part of the college has helped him succeed .",
            "Lippman is now completing an internship with the New York City-based International Dyslexic Association , boasting a 3.676 finish for the last term , and meeting with editors from the Princeton Review to modify listings of services for the disabled listed by colleges .",
            "He 's impressed faculty and developed mentors , including Dr. Rudy Nydegger , a clinical psychologist who teaches management and psychology at the college .",
