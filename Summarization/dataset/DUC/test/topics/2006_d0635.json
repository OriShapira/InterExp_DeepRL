            "AUSTIN , Texas _ Of the 127 men and women who have been executed in Texas during his time in office , Governor George W. Bush makes one categorical claim : none of them were innocent .",
            "`` There 's no doubt in my mind that each person who has been executed in our state was guilty of the crime committed , '' Bush says .",
            "The Texas governor 's claim is supported by the prosecutors and law enforcement officials who worked on those cases , the juries that concluded that the defendants were guilty , and the failure of journalists and death penalty foes to find an incontestable case where an innocent person was executed .",
            "Indeed , a Boston Globe review of the 127 Texas death penalty cases found that there was powerful proof of guilt _ uncontradicted scientific evidence , freely offered confessions , or an admission of regret just before the execution _ in nine out of 10 cases .",
            "Yet , in a handful of Texas cases , in which convicts never wavered from saying they were innocent , doubts remain .",
            "Doubts of varying degree .",
            "Doubts that did not convince a jury .",
            "Doubts that leave defense attorneys skeptical of Bush 's claim .",
            "`` It is statistically inconceivable that no innocent people have been executed or will be executed , '' says attorney Stephen Latimer .",
            "`` The Texas system is not infallible . ''",
            "Latimer represented David Stoker , who was executed in 1997 despite years of insisting that he had been framed for the murder of a convenience store clerk .",
            "While there was evidence tying Stoker to the pistol used in the fatal holdup , no physical evidence placed him at the store or established that he owned the gun at the time the crime took place .",
            "An informant turned the gun in to police and blamed Stoker for the murder .",
            "The informant , described by even Stoker 's prosecutor as a `` lowlife scum drug dealer , '' received reward money and had charges against him dropped in a criminal case .",
            "`` Stoker maintained his innocence until the day he died , '' said Latimer .",
            "Bush 's presidential candidacy ensured that the Stoker case , and a handful of others like it , would become grist for the national news media .",
            "CBS News and several major newspapers have dispatched reporters to Texas to investigate the governor 's record .",
            "Bush 's aides , in turn , have polled prosecutors in far-off corners of the state , to make sure the governor can stand by his claim of certainty .",
            "`` The governor 's office did call me , '' said Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra , who prosecuted Danny Castillo , executed in 1998 .",
            "`` I did verify that he was guilty . ''",
            "Castillo was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally slashing and stabbing a south Texas liquor store clerk during a 1983 robbery .",
            "The police found bloodied moneybags at the home of a relative where Castillo was staying , and a footprint left at the store matched a footprint discovered at the scene of another armed robbery for which Castillo was convicted .",
            "But there was no physical evidence tying Castillo to the liquor store crime , and the footprints were from a common brand of athletic shoe .",
            "It was a difficult case for both sides .",
            "`` There was no really hard-core physical evidence , '' Guerra said .",
            "`` I lost friendships afterwards over this . ''",
            "`` I do n't think there is a silver bullet in this case , '' said attorney Paul Swacina , who handled Castillo 's appeals .",
            "`` David 's case was in the gray area . ''",
            "Mike Jones , deputy director of communications for the governor , reacting to the handful of ambiguous cases turned up during the Globe survey , said that `` the governor and his legal staff carefully review each case involving a convicted killer who is sentenced to death .",
            "In each case , state and federal courts have already considered evidence and arguments presented by the defendants .",
            "`` When the actual facts of these cases are reviewed fairly and objectively , instead of in a one-sided , sensational manner , it 's clear each killer executed in Texas was guilty of the crime for which he was convicted , '' Jones said .",
            "Bush declined an invitation to comment for this article , but when questioned about his record on the campaign trail , he has generally repeated what he said in his autobiography .",
            "`` I review every death penalty case thoroughly , '' Bush wrote .",
            "`` And early in my administration , I decided the standards by which I would decide whether to allow an execution to proceed .",
            "In every case , I would ask : Is there any doubt about this individual 's guilt or innocence ?",
            "And , have the courts have ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case ? ''",
            "At the time that Texas executed pick ax murderer Karla Faye Tucker in 1998 , Bush wrote , he was challenged at the dinner table by one of his teenage daughters , who declared her opposition to the death penalty .",
            "`` I told my daughter that sometimes in life you have to make decisions that are not easy , but they should always be based on principle , '' Bush wrote .",
            "`` In this case , the principle was to uphold the law of the land .",
            "I took an oath to do so .",
            "`` I believe decisions about the death penalty are primarily the responsibility of the judicial branch of government , '' Bush wrote .",
            "`` I do n't believe my role is to replace the verdict of a jury with my own . ''",
            "In just one case has Bush decided that there were enough concerns about innocence to intervene : that of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas , whose confession to a Texas murder was shown to be a lie .",
            "Bush agreed with the recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and commuted the sentence to life in prison .",
            "The confluence of events that has pushed Bush 's record on capital punishment into the public eye is likely to keep it there .",
            "The governor will next confront an assertion of innocence in June , when death row inmate Gary Graham is scheduled to die .",
            "Over the last two decades , Graham 's case has attracted the attention of sympathetic journalists , movie stars such as Danny Glover , and organized foes of capital punishment .",
            "Though Graham admittedly took part in a violent felonious crime spree that included 22 crimes in the spring of 1981 , including an armed robbery in which a victim was shot , he denies that he shot Bobby Lambert in a robbery outside a Houston supermarket .",
            "As in the case of Stoker , there is no physical evidence to tie him to the crime .",
            "Graham was 17 at the time of the murder .",
            "He was convicted largely on the basis of eyewitness Bernadine Skillern 's testimony , though other eyewitnesses could not corroborate the identification .",
            "A gun Graham possessed at the time of his arrest was tested by the prosecution and was ruled out as the murder weapon .",
            "`` Gary is the only client I have had in Texas who we thought is innocent , and I still believe he is , '' said Graham 's attorney , Richard Burr , a veteran capital defense lawyer and death penalty foe .",
            "Skillern , who saw the shooting take place and chased the assailant for a time in her car , `` is very adamant that she 's right , '' Burr said .",
            "`` I 'm convinced she is wrong , and there is no other evidence at all . ''",
            "Public support for capital punishment has slipped a notch in polls in recent months with the news that more than 80 inmates has been freed from death row , including seven from Texas , since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s .",
            "In many of these cases , and in dozens of non-capital convictions , DNA technology has exposed flaws in the US judicial system .",
            "`` We certainly think innocent people have been executed , '' said Barry Scheck , a nationally known DNA expert and a leader of the New York-based `` Innocence Project , '' whose recent book on the issue helped persuade conservative columnist George F. Will and others to call for a reexamination of capital punishment .",

            "George W. Bush followed his parole board 's advice Friday and halted Tuesday 's planned execution of Henry Lee Lucas , saying that too many doubts persist about the confessed killer 's guilt in the case that sent him to Death Row .",
            "`` I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case carefully , '' Bush said in a written statement .",
            "`` The first question I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the individual 's guilt or innocence .",
            "`` This is the first case since I have been the governor when the answer to that question is ` Yes . '",
            "'' Lucas , 61 , once confessed to 600 killings .",
            "He was scheduled to die in Huntsville for the Halloween 1979 rape and strangulation of a still-unidentified woman whose almost-nude body was found near Interstate 35 in Williamson County .",
            "But , as in many of the slayings Lucas admitted to , evidence later emerged suggesting that the drifter was nowhere near when the crime was committed .",
            "Bush 's decision means that the oldest inmate on Huntsville 's Death Row will soon be transferred to the prison system 's diagnostic center , where he will undergo psychological evaluation and other tests before being permanently reassigned .",
            "`` I can only thank them for believing the truth and having the guts to stand up for what 's right , '' Lucas said in a statement released by prison officials .",
            "Bush 's decision does not give Lucas hope for regaining his freedom .",
            "He is serving six other life sentences , and 210 years in prison for nine other murders .",
            "A murder charge pending in Florida could earn him the death penalty if he were to obtain parole or a pardon in Texas .",
            "Bush , a staunch defender of the death penalty , has not intervened in the imminent execution of inmate since taking office 3 1/2 years ago .",
            "In February , he declined to stop the execution of Karla Faye Tucker , who professed a conversion to Christianity and publicly expressed remorse for her part in using a pickax to hack to death a couple in Houston .",
            "Numerous religious leaders , including Pope John Paul II , called for Tucker to be spared .",
            "Bush said he allowed the execution to go forward because she was undeniably guilty .",
            "Tucker , who never claimed innocence , became the first woman to be executed in Texas since the Civil War .",
            "Bush raised concerns this month about whether Lucas should be executed after former Attorney General Jim Mattox cited a 1986 investigation by his office , which showed that the condemned man was probably in Florida when the 1979 Texas murder occurred .",
            "Mattox , a Democrat who is again running for attorney general , and Bush , a Republican , said Lucas is guilty of other crimes and should never be released from prison .",
            "But carrying out the execution for a case in which guilt is not absolutely certain would be abhorrent , both said .",
            "`` Governor Bush 's decision will make our death penalty punishment stronger than ever , '' said Mattox , who added that police should reopen cases in which Lucas made confessions .",
            "`` But it was still politically risky , and I 'd be glad to stand up and defend him against attack . ''",
            "Bush 's first rebuke came from fellow Republican John Cornyn , who is running against Mattox in the attorney general 's race .",
            "`` I have confidence both in the jury who heard this case and in the 23 ( appellate ) judges who reviewed the evidence , '' said Cornyn , a former Texas Supreme Court Justice .",
            "`` I believe their decision should be respected and their sentence carried out . ''",
            "A spokesman for Democrat Garry Mauro , Bush 's opponent in November 's election , said the governor may see some political fallout from his actions .",
            "`` The initial downside for Bush is whether or not the Christian Coalition decides to call him a fraud because he would n't get involved with the parole board with Karla Faye Tucker , but he 's following Jim Mattox 's lead on Henry Lee Lucas , '' said Joe Cutbirth , Mauro 's spokesman .",
            "Bush 's decision in the Lucas case , made public 24 hours after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced its recommendation , caps one of Texas ' most bizarre crime sagas .",
            "Lucas , a drifter who had served time in Michigan for killing his mother , was arrested in Montague County , Texas , in June 1983 for being an ex-con with a weapon .",
            "While in jail , he confessed to killing an elderly woman who had disappeared from her home in Ringgold .",
            "He also told the sheriff that he had killed a 15-year-old girl who had hitchhiked with him on trips across the South and West .",
            "Other confessions followed , and soon Lucas ' tally of death numbered in the hundreds .",
            "Almost all were later proved to have been hoaxes , but Williamson County officials prosecuted him for the 1979 slaying and secured the death penalty .",

            "In a 5-4 ruling , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , the state 's highest criminal court , blocked Robison 's execution and sent the question of whether he is mentally competent back to the trial court .",

            "Supporters say Bush , the Republican presidential nominee , allows the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship .",
            "''The governor leaves it up to each parole board member to make their own decisions after they review the case .",
            "They 're an independent body , '' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones .",
            "Others contend that Bush does direct the board -- through his public statements on executions and his power to appoint members to their six-year , $ 80,000-per-year jobs .",
            "All current board members are Bush appointees .",
            "''It does seem that they would want to be in line with his way of thinking about it , '' said Richard C. Dieter , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center .",
            "Bush has said he supports the death penalty and does n't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration .",
            "But David Dow , a University of Houston law professor who represents condemned inmates , suggests both Bush and his Democratic predecessor , Ann Richards , have used the parole board `` as an excuse to avoid having to make a tough , moral decision . ''",
            "In Texas , the governor can only issue a one-time , 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole board to grant a stay , commute a sentence or issue a pardon .",
            "Those limits evolved from a pardons scandal in the 1920s and are aimed at preventing a governor from granting continuous reprieves .",
            "Since Bush became governor in 1995 , the state has executed 143 people , including 32 this year .",
            "Texas has executed 231 people in the past two decades , the most in the nation .",
            "Three more executions are scheduled before the Nov. 7 presidential election , including that of high-profile inmate Ricky Nolen McGinn on Sept. 27 .",
            "Bush granted a 30-day reprieve for McGinn in June -- the only reprieve he has granted as governor -- so that further DNA testing could be done .",
            "But the tests failed to clear McGinn in the rape and murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter .",
            "Bush never has witnessed an execution .",
            "For the most part , he limits his role to privately quizzing his attorneys about cases , aides say .",
            "Unlike Richards , who met with her general counsel about executions , Bush has met with the staff lawyers who studied condemned inmates ' cases , said Jim Sallans , a former staff attorney who reviewed death row cases for both governors .",
            "Sallans left after Bush 's first term .",
            "Bush would read the lawyer 's memo -- about three to four pages -- and talk with the attorney , usually from 15 minutes to 45 minutes but perhaps up to two hours , Sallans said .",
            "Ultimately , Sallans said , Bush would ask : `` OK , Did he do it ?",
            "Did he get a fair trial ? ''",

            "George Ryan , a Republican , has done .",
            "But some suggest Bush , if concerned about the fairness of Texas ' death penalty , could use his power of persuasion to generate public support for a moratorium .",
            "''He could have a much higher profile in the Texas death penalty debate , if he wanted to , '' said Dow , the professor who has represented inmates .",
            "Dow also contends that governors can communicate with the parole board as much as they wish , through direct dialogue or public statements .",
            "Case in point : Henry Lee Lucas .",
            "Bush asked the parole board to investigate the conviction of Lucas , a drifter sentenced to death for the murder of an unidentified woman known as `` Orange Socks . ''",
            "The parole board recommended commuting Lucas ' sentence to life in prison , and Bush approved it in June 1998 .",
            "The case of Karla Faye Tucker -- a pickax murderer , a Christian convert and the first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War era -- was more clear-cut for Bush .",
            "'' I told him that 's an easy one , '' Sallans recalls .",
            "''She did it , she confessed to it , she got a very fair trial . ''",

            "And rightly so .",
            "In five years in office , he has overseen the executions of 113 death row inmates , more than any other governor in any state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 .",
            "But the relentless efficiency of his state 's death row machinery is about to intersect , vividly , with Bush 's pursuit of his party 's presidential nomination .",
            "In the five weeks before the Iowa and New Hampshire presidential contests , Texas is scheduled to execute eight more people , among them convicts whose cases put the debate about the death penalty into high relief .",
            "Two of the eight committed their crimes as juveniles .",
            "One claims to have been convicted on the basis of a faulty DNA test .",
            "One is a paranoid schizophrenic whose condition went untreated _ until he killed .",
            "And then there 's Johnny Paul Penry .",
            "Even supporters of capital punishment have been troubled by the Penry case .",
            "There is no excusing his heinous crime : In 1979 , while on parole for a previous rape conviction , he broke into the home of Pamela Carpenter , raped her , and then stabbed her to death with the scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece .",
            "But Penry has the intellectual capacity of a 7-year-old .",
            "He never got past the first grade and spent his childhood years in and out of mental institutions .",
            "Court records describe how his mother beat him as a baby and dipped him in scalding water .",
            "She forced him to eat his bodily wastes , according to those records .",
            "Penry 's execution is sure to gain national attention , for it was in his case in 1989 that the US Supreme Court issued a controversial ruling that the death penalty for retarded individuals is not a constitutionally prohibited `` cruel and unusual punishment . ''",
            "He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Jan. 13 .",
            "Bush has not spoken publicly about the Penry case and , in keeping with his normal practice , he would not examine the facts of the case until the date set for execution .",
            "Bush has never granted such a reprieve .",
            "And it was the governor 's opposition last spring that led to the scuttling of a bill that passed one house of the Texas Legislature .",
            "It would have banned executions of the mentally retarded .",
            "The case of another Texas convict , Larry Robison , who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia , poses another issue : whether the mentally ill should be executed .",
            "In a bloody rampage , Robison slaughtered two men , two women , and an 11-year-old boy near Fort Worth in 1982 .",
            "Before he launched his murderous spree by decapitating and sexually mutilating his male housemate , Robison had no history of violence .",
            "His illness had been diagnosed when he was 21 , but he was turned away from treatment because he lacked health insurance .",
            "He has requested Jan. 21 as an execution date , because he wants to die on a night of a full moon .",
            "The scheduled executions of Glen McGinnis ( Jan. 25 ) and Anzel Jones ( Jan. 26 ) and David Hicks ( Jan. 20 ) offer other windows onto the death penalty and how determinedly Texas and Bush enforce it .",
            "McGinnis and Jones were both juveniles , 17 years old , when they committed their brutal crimes .",
            "Hicks , meanwhile , claims that faulty DNA analysis helped convict him of a crime he did not commit _ the rape and murder of his grandmother .",
            "The death penalty has not yet emerged as a campaign issue in a nation where roughly two of three voters , and three of four Republicans , endorse the practice .",
            "Here in Texas , the most prominent victims ' rights organization speaks for many when giving Bush its whole-hearted support .",
            "`` Governor Bush has been a very receptive and reasonable governor when it comes to issues of crime and criminal justice , '' said Dianne Clements , president of Justice for All , the Houston-based victims group .",
            "`` There is poll after poll that proves the citizens of Texas support the death penalty , the ultimate punishment . ''",
            "Clements defends the use of the death penalty , even in those cases where the offender was 17 at the time of the crime , or mentally disabled .",
            "`` If they are competent to be convicted , then so be it , '' she said .",
            "But death penalty opponents contend that Bush 's record-setting embrace of capital punishment may yet be a negative factor for him in the 2000 election .",
            "He shows a callousness , they say , toward the solemn issues that arise from government 's ultimate power : taking the life of its citizens .",
            "Beyond the overall support given to capital punishment in the polls , `` the realization is growing that the death penalty , like a lot of other things that government does , has serious problems , '' said Stephen Bright , director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta .",
            "`` People reasonably expect that the governor of Texas ought to be concerned about executing the mentally retarded , or those who had poor legal representation , '' said Bright .",
            "`` If you are going to be executing those who were children when they committed the crime , or people who are mentally ill , the governor ought to at least be engaged .",
            "You do n't get the sense that Bush is engaged at all . ''",
            "Bush reinforced such doubts when , in a magazine interview last summer , he mocked the eleventh-hour plea for mercy by a convicted double murderer , Karla Faye Tucker , imitating her by whimpering `` Please , do n't kill me '' with pursed lips .",
            "Tucker , whose born-again faith and repentance for her crimes was cited in requests for mercy made to Bush by such figures as Pope John Paul II and televangelist Pat Robertson , was the first woman to be executed by the state of Texas since the Civil War .",
            "And in a recent case that spurred headlines across the country , Texas authorities used an airplane and a team of medical attendants to fly David Long from the intensive care ward of a Galveston hospital to the death chamber in Huntsville on Dec. 8 so he could be executed on his appointed date .",
            "He had tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of anti-psychotic drugs .",
            "`` Putting him on life support and flying him out of the hospital so they can kill him ?",

            "`` There is a growing volume of cases in Texas that make it sound like however the system is supposed to work , this is not it . ''",
            "At a time when the well-publicized releases of dozens of death row inmates found innocent by DNA testing has sparked a national movement for a moratorium on capital punishment , and led to a slight downtick in support for the practice in public opinion polls , foes of the death penalty hope to use the upcoming primary season to publicize their cause and pressure Bush to intervene on behalf of those scheduled to die .",
            "Bush 's legislative record raises further issues .",
            "Despite repeated judicial criticism of the way that Texas provides legal services to indigent defendants in capital punishment and other criminal cases _ via a court-appointed patronage system _ Bush vetoed a bill that would have reformed the system and established an independent public defender 's office this year .",
            "In a chapter on the death penalty in his campaign autobiography , Bush says that he treats his `` profound '' responsibility in capital punishment cases `` thoughtfully and carefully , '' but that he limits his decisions on whether to intervene to two matters : `` Is there any doubt about this individual 's guilt or innocence ?",
            "And , have the courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case ? ''",
            "As a matter of political philosophy , Bush says , he does not believe he has the right to `` replace the verdict of a jury with my own '' in order to show mercy , or for potentially mitigating factors like age , mental illness , or mental retardation .",

            "AUSTIN , Texas _ The issue of law and order has always been part of George W. Bush 's politics .",
            "He ran for governor of Texas in 1994 with a series of grainy black-and-white commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at gunpoint in a parking garage and , a moment later , a police officer draping a blanket over the woman 's body .",
            "Charging that his Democratic opponent , Gov .",
            "Ann Richards , was soft on crime , Bush promised to get tougher with criminals .",
            "That stand helped him win , and an examination of his record over the nearly five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent in pressing a law-and-order agenda .",
            "Bush has presided over the nation 's largest prison-building program and a record number of executions in his tenure as governor .",
            "He has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to carry guns and has opposed gun-control legislation .",
            "`` For Governor Bush , gun control is not yet part of crime control , '' said Travis County Constable Bruce Elfant , one of the many law-enforcement officials who have come to see gun control as important as fighting drugs and gangs in the battle against crime .",
            "In a conservative state where being `` Texas tough '' is high praise , Bush 's positions have been popular .",
            "How Bush 's record on criminal justice , particularly gun control , will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for president .",
            "In Texas , experts on criminal justice are studying another question : whether his policies are responsible for the state 's drop in crime Bush 's spokeswoman , Karen Hughes , said his initiatives , especially those toughening punishment for juvenile offenders and making convicts serve longer terms , had produced a 20 percent drop in the Texas crime rate .",
            "But according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , crime had already fallen 25 percent under Gov .",
            "Richards , from 1991 to 1994 , as she pushed a multibillion-dollar-prison-building program .",
            "Since Bush took office in 1995 , crime rates have also fallen as much , or more , in most states as they have in Texas .",
            "This has led governors and mayors across the country to take credit , even as many experts point out that the widespread decline in crime rates makes it less likely that any one policy can be credited .",
            "Longer prison sentences are one factor in the overall decrease , experts say , but so are an improved economy , a decline in the use of crack , new police strategies and changing attitudes among young people .",
            "When Bush ran against Gov .",
            "Richards , when he pledged to support a concealed-weapons bill .",
            "When , as governor , he signed the bill into law in 1995 , he declared , `` This is a bill to make Texas a safer place . ''",
            "The bill had been championed by the National Rifle Association , but was opposed by the police chiefs of Texas ' largest cities , who were concerned that the law would lead to more violent confrontations between individuals armed with guns and a greater risk to police officers .",
            "The bill 's opponents had predicted it would lead to a rash of shootings .",
            "Supporters said it would sharply cut crime .",
            "Neither seems to have happened .",
            "Bush went against the police chiefs of Texas ' seven largest cities this spring by opposing a bill to require background checks on all prospective firearms buyers at gun shows .",
            "According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , gun shows are the leading source of guns for criminals and juveniles in Texas .",
            "The bill requiring background checks died in committee April 20 , a few hours after the school killings in Littleton , Colo. , which were carried out with guns bought at gun shows .",
            "Under Bush , Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the country , with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or parole .",
            "Texas ' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents , second only to Louisiana 's 736 .",
            "By contrast , Minnesota , with the lowest incarceration rate , has 117 inmates per 100,000 people .",
            "The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov .",
            "Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took office in 1995 .",
            "In 1989 , the state prison system had 41,000 beds .",
            "When the buildup is completed next year , it will have 150,000 beds .",
            "The Bush administration says the total cost will approach $ 3 billion , while some of the state 's leading Democrats put the figure at $ 10 billion .",
            "In any event , Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued growth of prisons , unlike California , where politicians have begun to question that state 's prison-building program .",
            "Republicans worry about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats argue that the program has taken money away from the state college and university system .",
            "The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending for public education , one of Bush 's priorities , said Eva DeLuna Castro , a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities , a nonpartisan research organization in Austin .",
            "One of Bush 's major planks in his race against Ms. Richards was a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of skyrocketing teen-age crime , and as governor , Bush has transformed the juvenile justice code .",
            "One result : a tripling of the number of young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission 's juvenile prisons , to 6,000 .",
            "`` If George W. Bush can do for the United States what he has done for Texas , no one can lick his boots , '' said Dallas Juvenile Court Judge Hal Gaither , an adviser to Bush who describes himself as `` the most conservative man in Texas . ''",
            "The major change under Bush , Gaither said , was switching the main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best interests of the child , its historical role , to more of a prison system in which punishment is emphasized .",
            "Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14 , increasing the maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile prisons .",
            "Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor , according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice .",
            "Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker , whose death-row conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev .",

            "She was only the second woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of capital punishment .",

            "But Bush chose not to intervene , saying : `` In every death penalty that comes to my desk , I ask this question : Innocent or guilty ?",
            "And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had in our state , I am confident that those that have been put to death have been guilty . ''",
            "Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms. Tucker becoming born-again , Bush said , `` I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority . ''",
            "Given the frequency of executions , some Texas legislators introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally retarded .",
            "Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .",
            "After the bill passed the state Senate , Bush announced his opposition , saying , `` I like the law the way it is right now , '' with juries having the right to make the decision .",

            "The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday halted the execution of a Canadian murderer , saying it wants more time to consider the claims of the 61-year-old man who confessed to bludgeoning an elderly woman and then burying a butcher knife in her chest .",
            "The stay was granted about 30 minutes before Joseph Stanley Faulder , convicted in the 1975 murder of the Gladewater , Texas , woman , was to be led into the death chamber at the Walls Unit in Huntsville .",
            "Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald broke word of the stay to Faulder , who was being held in a cell a short distance from the death chamber , shortly before 6 p.m. CST `` Far out , that suits me , '' Faulder responded .",
            "`` He was a very happy man , '' Fitzgerald said .",
            "`` He again thanked the Canadian people and the Canadian media who helped to focus attention on the case . ''",
            "That Faulder was notified of the stay only minutes before the scheduled 6 p.m. execution , was `` absolutely abominable , '' said Sandra Babcock , his attorney .",
            "Babcock , who was one of two people Faulder asked to witness the execution , detailed the convoluted series of legal actions to save her client , blasting the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for alleged irregularities in its clemency considerations .",

            "He found out about the stay just minutes before the appointed hour of his execution .",
            "That is cruel and unusual punishment . ''",
            "Although it had appeared Wednesday that Faulder might escape his date with the executioner based on his claims that Texas ' clemency process is unconstitutional , that issue was never raised in the high court , said Doug Danzeiser , an assistant attorney general who handled the case for the state .",
            "Instead , Danzeiser said , the Supreme Court granted the stay while it determines if it wants to hold formal arguments on claims that Faulder 's rights had been violated under international law and that prosecutors suppressed evidence at his trial .",
            "But Maurie Levin , an Austin attorney involved in Faulder 's class action lawsuit over Texas ' clemency process , said some lawyers were speculating that the Supreme Court may well have granted a stay knowing the clemency issue remained unresolved .",
            "Since the only issues in Faulder 's case pending before the Supreme Court involved international law and suppression of evidence , it could halt the execution only on those issues , Levin said .",

            "On Wednesday , U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin halted the executions of Faulder and another killer , Danny Barber .",
            "Barber was sentenced to die for the 1979 attack on Janice Louise Ingram at her home in Balch Springs , a suburb southeast of Dallas .",
            "He also confessed to three other slayings for which he received life sentences .",
            "Sparks found that since the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles casts its votes on clemency in secrecy there is no way to determine whether the Texas process meets due process requirements that the Supreme Court has said must exist .",
            "The state appealed Sparks ' rulings to the 5th Circuit .",
            "One three-judge panel overturned the stay in Faulder 's case , but another three-judge panel refused to in Barber 's case .",
            "Faulder , who would have been the first Canadian to be executed in the United States since 1952 , had been on Texas ' death row 21 years .",
            "His death sentence focused international opposition on Texas ' death penalty , with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy joining U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in calling for a reprieve .",

            "Period . ''",
            "Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976 .",
            "Much criticism of Texas centered on the allegation that state authorities had violated an international treaty in not allowing Faulder to contact Canadian consular officials after he was arrested .",
            "Texas authorities said the killer was carrying a Colorado drivers license at the time of his arrest , and his nationality was not immediately known .",

            "`` If he thought that he got such a raw deal and that the embassy could have helped , do n't you think he would have contacted them before he sat on death row for 15 years ? ''",
            "Fifteen years elapsed before his family and the Canadian government learned of his incarceration in Texas .",
            "A new execution date can not be set for Faulder unless the Supreme Court lifts its stay ; under state law , at least 30 days must elapse between the lifting of a stay and the setting of a new death date .",
            "The decision by the Supreme Court also leaves standing orders by Sparks , the federal judge , to conduct evidentiary hearings on the clemency procedures in Texas .",
            "Sparks set hearing dates of Dec. 21 and Dec. 22 in Faulder 's and Barber 's cases , respectively .",
            "In ordering the hearings , Sparks took a swipe at the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for not settling the issue .",
            "`` This court bemoans the fact that neither of the state 's highest courts have ruled on the merits of Faulder 's claims or stayed the execution to give themselves time to consider the merits , '' Sparks wrote .",
            "Faulder 's claims that Texas ' clemency procedures are constitutionally flawed are nearly identical to the claims that attorneys for Karla Faye Tucker , the first woman put to death in Texas since the 1800s , raised last year before she was executed .",
            "Tucker , however , never was granted a stay on those claims .",
            "In his Faulder opinion , Sparks noted that at the time Tucker raised her claims , there was no case law laying out a constitutional right to clemency under federal law .",
            "After Tucker was executed , though , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of an Ohio prisoner who challenged that state 's parole procedures .",
            "In that case , Sparks noted , five justices `` agreed that a death-row inmate has a life interest in avoiding execution separate and independent from his life and liberty interests at stake in his trial and sentencing , and therefore ` some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings . ' ''",
            "Although the Supreme Court did not specify what process would meet minimal standards , Sparks wrote , `` it is unclear where the Texas procedure would fall '' because the parole board does not specify how it reaches its decisions .",
            "`` It is unclear how the board can document that its procedures are not arbitrary if it does not document its procedures at all , '' Sparks wrote .",
            "Dave Atwood , president of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and one of Tucker 's attorneys , praised the Supreme Court 's decision and the pressure Canadian capital punishment opponents had applied in the case .",
            "`` If not for them , this execution would have gone forward , '' he said .",
            "Faulder 's niece , Barbara Allen , 39 , of Jasper , Alberta , said she was `` ecstatic '' about the stay , then noted the word hardly conveyed the level of emotion she felt .",
            "She said she had visited her uncle Thursday afternoon _ her fourth visit with him since her arrival Saturday _ and found him composed .",

            "George W. Bush confronts yet another closely scrutinized death penalty case this week , the immediate decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half years in office : whether or not to use his limited power to halt the next one .",
            "But now that Bush is running for president and the eyes of an entire nation are upon him as never before , he faces a second , amplified challenge .",
            "It is to demonstrate , through the tone of his voice and the set of his jaw , that he feels the full weight of his responsibility .",
            "And it is to show , through his bearing and his choice of words , that he comes by his steadfast position in support of the death penalty after extensive soul-searching and careful thought .",
            "Because of the stakes involved , the emotions it stirs and the welling questions about the fairness of its administration , the death penalty has become one of the tests of Bush 's seriousness , a quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk .",
            "And while there is little or no hint in public opinion surveys that his advocacy of capital punishment in itself carries political risks , there is certainly reason to believe that more than a few voters are watching , and judging , the manner in which he navigates this sensitive terrain .",
            "`` He needs to be careful to portray this in the most sober and respectful of lights , '' said Bruce Buchanan , a professor who teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas .",
            "`` Any evidence of being perfunctory or lacking sensitivity is a problem for him , not necessarily in terms of politics but in terms of gravitas . ''",
            "The current case in question is that of Gary Graham , scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Thursday in Huntsville , Texas .",
            "Graham was convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the embattled testimony of a single eyewitness .",
            "Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas governor 's powers generally , he may have little or no discretion over Graham 's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles renders its ruling on the matter this week .",
            "If the board authorizes execution , the most the governor can typically do is grant a one-time , 30-day reprieve .",
            "And Bush 's ability to do even that in Graham 's case is in question , since Gov .",
            "Ann W. Richards granted such a reprieve to Graham in 1993 .",
            "But whatever the limits on Bush 's discretion , they do not alter the burden on his public comments and demeanor when the moment of decision comes .",
            "`` This gravitas issue is a very important one , '' said Stephen J. Wayne , a professor of government at Georgetown University who specializes in the American presidency .",
            "`` I do n't think he can say , in a snide way , ` I 'm going through with this , he 's guilty , period , ' '' Wayne said .",
            "`` He 's got to demonstrate some reflection in his words . ''",
            "The capacity to do so is something that many Americans want in a president , said Wayne , who , along with other political analysts , noted that there had been a few occasions when Bush failed to exhibit it .",
            "A profile of Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene , which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized , in which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye Tucker , a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed .",
            "And there was a moment during a Republican presidential debate in early March when Bush laughed , perhaps somewhat nervously , when asked about a Texas lawyer who fell asleep during a trial that ended with a death sentence for his client .",
            "Those examples are extreme .",
            "But there have been many other times when Bush , who seldom holds any private introspection up to public light , has responded to questions about capital punishment with strikingly terse answers conspicuously lifted from a well-worn script .",
            "Bush and his aides seem to be at least partly conscious of that and eager to cast his ruminations on death penalty cases as prolonged and profound .",
            "That was the portrait of the governor that emerged in the autobiography he published last year , `` A Charge to Keep , '' written primarily by his communications director , Karen P. Hughes .",
            "An entire chapter of the book was devoted to the death penalty .",
            "Earlier this month , for the first time since entering office , Bush granted a death-row inmate a 30-day reprieve , in defiance of the Board of Pardons and Paroles .",
            "The issue in the case was the possibility that further DNA testing could clarify the facts presented at trial , and Bush 's decision allowed him to show that he was neither oblivious nor aloof to a central , scientific reason for the changing dynamics of the death penalty debate .",
            "On Monday , aboard the campaign plane that brought him out to the West Coast to begin a week of campaigning that he knew would be dominated by the latest scheduled execution in Texas , Bush was more voluble on the death penalty than usual .",
            "He said not only that he was standing his ground `` in the face of a pretty considerable movement to undermine the death penalty in Texas , '' but also that he understood the passion of that crusade .",
            "`` I harbor no ill will , '' Bush told reporters .",
            "`` I understand it 's a very emotional issue for people .",
            "It 's an issue where fine people disagree . ''",
            "Talking about how much attention he was paying to Graham 's case , he emphasized that he had spent the entire `` trip from the governor 's mansion to the plane '' _ a drive of 15 to 20 minutes _ talking to a state lawyer about it .",
            "Asked whether accounts like the one about the sleeping lawyer made him wonder whether people were getting fair trials , he quickly and succinctly responded , `` That 's what the appellate process is for . ''",
            "But several hours later , he returned to the reporter who had posed the question and pointed out that in that case , the defendant had confessed .",
            "Bush had clearly gone and done some research .",

            "In 1997 , Amnesty International had declared that it violated international human rights standards .",
            "But after the Tucker and Lucas cases , newspapers across the state editorialized for change .",
            "As it turned out , one obstacle to change would be Bush .",
            "The Dallas Morning News , the state 's leading newspaper , noted that the clemency process was shrouded in secrecy .",
            "The 18-member paroles board did not meet to discuss applications .",
            "Instead , members reviewed cases separately and faxed in their votes from across the state .",
            "The board operated without guidelines and offered no explanation of its decisions .",
            "Early last year , Judge Sam Sparks of U.S. District Court in Austin found that the Texas clemency system did meet the `` minimal procedural safeguards '' required by the U.S. Supreme Court .",
            "But in his opinion , the judge criticized the process , writing : `` It is abundantly clear the Texas clemency procedure is extremely poor and certainly minimal .",
            "Legislatively , there is a dearth of meaningful procedure .",
            "Administratively , the goal is more to protect the secrecy and autonomy of the system rather than carrying out an efficient legally sound system .",
            "The board would not have to sacrifice its conservative ideology to carry out its duties in a more fair and accurate fashion . ''",
            "Before the 1999 legislative session , state Rep. Elliott Naishstat , a Democrat from Austin , filed two bills that would require the Board of Pardons and Paroles to consider clemency appeals in public meetings and to consider issues such as rehabilitation .",
            "But in an interview with The Austin American-Statesman , Bush said , `` It 's going to have to take an awfully compelling argument for me to support the change . ''",
            "Public clemency meetings , he warned , might create `` a chance for people to rant and rail , a chance for people to emotionalize the process beyond the questions that need to be asked . ''",
            "Both of Naishstat 's bills died in the legislative session .",
            "`` The governor 's office did not want the clemency procedure in Texas changed , '' Naishstat said in a recent interview .",
            "In the same session , Bush also spoke out against a bill offered by state Sen. Rodney Ellis , a Democrat from Houston , that would have banned executions of mentally retarded inmates .",
            "That bill ultimately died , as well .",
            "A bill the Legislature did pass , unanimously , would have given county governments more authority to establish public defender systems , rather than local judges , and required that indigent defendants be appointed counsels within 20 days .",
            "Unlike some states , Texas does not have a statewide public defender system ; normally , elected judges in each county appoint lawyers , including campaign contributors , to represent poor defendants .",
            "Last year , a Houston Chronicle investigation found that defendants with appointed lawyers in Harris County , which includes Houston , were twice as likely to go to jail as those who could afford to hire lawyers .",
            "Harris has more inmates on death row than any other county .",
            "In October , a federal district judge set aside a death sentence against Calvin Jerold Burdine because his lawyer slept throughout much of the trial , held in Harris County .",
            "But Bush vetoed Ellis ' bill .",
            "The governor said it would not improve legal counsel for the poor and and that the 20-day limit could allow someone to be released improperly from jail ."
