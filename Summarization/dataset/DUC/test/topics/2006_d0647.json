            "HANOI , April 17 ( Xinhua ) -- A spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Monday demands that the United States immediately return Cuban Boy Elian Gonzales so that he can reunite with his father .",
            "Spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Phan Thuy Thanh made the demand when she was answering a question on Vietnam 's latest viewpoint regarding this matter .",
            "She affirmed Vietnam 's consistent stance of resolute demand that the United States immediately end the anti-Cuban embargo and strictly observe the Immigration Agreement signed in 1994 and 1995 between the governments of Cuba and the United States , under which the United States pledged to return to Cuba all illegal Cuban deportees ."

            "WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba .",
            "At the same time , a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8 , an action that may make it more difficult for the Justice Department to put its plan into effect .",
            "Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking control of Elian by asserting that the boy 's Miami relatives had failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost their court fight .",
            "As a result , the officials said , they were considering revoking an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in November .",
            "Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami with the lawyers for Elian 's Miami relatives to try to resolve the situation .",
            "But Justice Department officials warned that they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts to return Elian to his father .",
            "Up to now , the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly that they would not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian in the United States .",
            "But they have declined to be more specific and to comply with the Justice Department 's demand .",
            "Kendall Coffey , a lawyer for the Miami relatives , said in an interview , `` We have said and we continue to affirm that the family will obey the law . ''",
            "But asked if that means that the family agrees to accept sending Elian back if the courts rule against them , Coffey said that he was `` reluctant to speak to that because we are far from that moment . ''",
            "He said that he thought the general statement that the family would comply with the law was `` more than sufficient . ''",
            "Justice Department lawyers disagree , regarding the careful statements by the family lawyers as holding on to their options to resist .",
            "Last week , David J. Kline , a lawyer in the Justice Department 's immigration office , said that the government had the authority to terminate permission for Elian 's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales to have temporary custody of the boy .",
            "But Kline said the agency would agree to that only if the relatives said clearly they would send Elian back three days after they lost in the appeals court unless they obtained an injunction from a court allowing them to file an expedited appeal with the Supreme Court .",
            "Kline also demanded that Elian 's family in Miami agree to an expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4 .",
            "But the appeals court Monday may have made the department 's case more difficult by agreeing to a slower schedule Justice Department officials have grown increasingly impatient with the tactics of the family .",
            "Some officials said that they might well move to take control of Elian and send him back to Cuba while the appeals are not yet completed .",
            "`` We have been more than generous , '' said one official .",
            "The Miami relatives have mounted a legal campaign to keep Elian in the United States as supporters in Congress and many in Miami 's large Cuban-American community have rallied to their cause .",
            "Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the boat he , his mother , and several others used in their attempt to come to the United States capsized .",
            "Elian 's mother and most of the other passengers drowned .",
            "The efforts of the Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United States suffered a setback last week when a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for the boy , concluding that a long , bitter legal battle was not in Elian 's best interest .",

            "WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez , the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle , decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here , government officials said on Tuesday night .",
            "But later , the boy 's great-uncle said in Miami that the meeting was off .",
            "In frantic last-minute negotiations , as the Justice Department prepared to order the transfer on Thursday morning in Florida , representatives of the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez , Elian 's father , agreed to a meeting in the Washington , D.C. , area , the officials said .",
            "But shortly before midnight , Lazaro Gonzales , the great-uncle who has custody of the boy , emerged from his house in Miami and said Elian did not want to go to Washington , so no one from the Miami family would go , The Associated Press reported .",
            "A crowd gathered there erupted with cheers .",
            "A government official said early Wednesday morning that efforts were still under way to try to arrange the meeting .",
            "The officials had said that Elian would be accompanied by Lazaro Gonzalez and Lazaro 's 21-year-old daughter , Marisleysis Gonzalez .",
            "Until Tuesday , the family had sought a meeting with the boy 's father , but had demanded that it occur in Florida .",
            "The meeting , if it takes place as planned , would end the lengthy custody battle with a peaceful transfer that Attorney General Janet Reno had struggled to piece together .",
            "After the meeting was announced , Justice Department officials expressed satisfaction that the end seemed to be in sight .",
            "Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the view of immigration officials .",
            "Those officials said they would urge Elian 's father to remain in the United States until the courts finally decide whether the boy should return to Cuba .",
            "`` We 've encouraged them to talk and tried to facilitate from the start , '' one official said .",
            "`` We 're happy that this appears to be an an opportunity for a new beginning . ''",
            "The first indication that the long dispute might be close to a conclusion came late Tuesday night from Miami where a spokeswoman for the Cuban American National Foundation said that representatives of the Miami relatives would meet with Elian 's father on Wednesday .",
            "She said that Sen. Robert G. Torricelli , D-N.J. , had helped arrange the meeting .",
            "Efforts to reach Torricelli on Tuesday night were unsuccessful .",
            "The development came after a hectic day in which Reno had first considered and then canceled plans to visit Miami .",
            "Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami , where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected local prosecutor .",
            "In recent days , Reno has spoken emotionally and emphatically at news conferences and television interviews about her sympathy for the many Cuban-Americans who vehemently oppose sending Elian back to the homeland ruled by of Fidel Castro , whom Reno has said she unequivocally opposes .",
            "But she has also said that international politics should not block the reunion of father and son , an outcome that she said was correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family values .",
            "Pediatric psychiatrists , she said , have recommended turning over Elian to his father .",
            "Still , the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian 's Florida relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their voyage from Cuba .",
            "The relatives have said they would obey the law , including a court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian 's father , but until Tuesday night , they had never agreed to turn the child over to his father , repeatedly asking for further legal review of whether the child should be returned to Cuba .",
            "The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week , Elian 's father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the Miami relatives , who were granted temporary custody until federal authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father .",
            "Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to Cuba .",
            "Earlier Tuesday , the boy 's relatives offered a proposal that was officially ignored by the Justice Department .",
            "In a letter distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez , the great-uncle with whom Elian has been living , the family said it would be willing to meet Elian 's father at any `` neutral place in South Florida . ''",
            "The letter added that the session would be followed immediately by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian .",
            "The relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting .",
            "Elian 's father , who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat in a Washington , D.C. , suburb , had said he does not want to meet the Miami relatives , but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick up his son .",
            "Afterward , the father has said , the adult members of the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation .",
            "At the Justice Department Tuesday , two Miami area mayors , Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami , met with Reno and Doris Meissner , commissioner of the immigration service , and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian 's father and the relatives .",
            "After the meeting , Reno issued a statement saying that she welcomed their suggestions .",
            "She added , `` The mayors have asked me to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated my willingness and desire to do so .",
            "We agreed to continue working together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with his father in the best way possible for him , his family and for the Miami community as a whole . ''",
            "Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to defect to the United States , the House Republican leadership and Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting on Wednesday in the Capitol .",

            "In Miami , it remained far from clear whether the boy 's relatives would give him up voluntarily or if the area 's powerful Cuban exile community would try to prevent his return home , no matter what the family decided to do .",
            "`` The passports are ready , and of course the airplane is ready , '' Castro said in a television broadcast from Havana that added another potentially volatile element to a political drama that has captured international attention and caused deep divisions within this country .",
            "In a vivid indication of just how intense the situation has become , the mayors of 23 municipalities around Miami Wednesday declared that they would not help federal forces if they tried to take custody of Elian .",
            "Elian 's relatives here , along with their lawyers , met with Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for nearly five hours Wednesday night , and will resume talks Thursday .",
            "Earlier Wednesday , the Gonzalez family 's spokesman said the family would not accede to the INS 's key demand : that they agree in writing to surrender the boy if an appeals court orders that he be returned to his father .",
            "Absent such a guarantee by Wednesday , immigration officials had threatened to revoke the boy 's permission to remain in the United States and seek custody of him at 9 a.m. Thursday .",
            "But late Wednesday , they extended the deadline for 24 hours .",
            "The family 's defiant stance has set up a potentially explosive scenario in which federal marshals may have to be dispatched to the city 's Little Havana section to remove the boy from the home of his great-uncle , Lazaro Gonzalez .",
            "If anything like that happens , the area 's mayors said at a press conference , they not only would refuse to provide any of their law enforcement personnel for support , but also would hold the Clinton administration accountable for the consequences .",

            "`` If their continued provocation , in the form of unjustified threats to revoke the boy 's parole , leads to civil unrest and violence , we are holding the federal government responsible , and specifically Janet Reno and the president of the United States , for anything that may occur in this community , '' he said .",
            "Penelas , who is of Cuban descent , said the local authorities would maintain order if protests got out of control .",
            "But the mayors ' extraordinary proclamation demonstrated how profoundly the differences over this issue have become in Southern Florida , where Cuban-Americans make up about one-third of the population .",
            "They also served as a sort of official warning that widespread demonstrations , which may be difficult to control , may be inevitable if the INS carries out its promise to return Elian to his father , even if Juan Miguel Gonzales comes to this country to get his son , rather than waits for him in Cuba .",
            "President Clinton seemed concerned Wednesday about both the prospect of violence and about the possibility that the Gonzalez family in Miami , members of the Cuban exile community , and local elected officials may be preparing to flout the federal government 's authority .",
            "`` I would hope that the law would be followed by everyone , including them , '' Clinton said at a press conference in Washington , referring to Elian 's relatives .",
            "`` I do n't think they should be singled out , and I do n't think they should have extra pressure put on them , but on the other hand I think they should observe the rule of the law . ''",
            "Castro 's announcement came as a surprise primarily because Juan Gonzalez has said that he would go to the United States only after his son 's case was resolved and the boy was ready to be taken back to Cuba .",
            "Assuming that he follows through on the revised plan _ while the case is still in the courts and Elian still lives at his great-uncle 's house _ it could help to resolve the conflict , since his relatives have said that they would be willing to give the boy to his father if he came to America .",
            "But the political and emotional atmosphere here has grown far more heated since that suggestion was made , and the family 's more recent comments have indicated that they may think Elian would be better off in this country regardless of what else happens .",
            "In any event , some officials of the Cuban exile community have made it clear that they do not want the boy returned to Cuba and will stage protests to try to prevent that from happening .",
            "A convoy of large trucks , their drivers blaring their horns and shouting their support for Elian , circled the neighborhood in which the boy is living Wednesday and vowed to come back in greater numbers Thursday .",
            "Moreover , individual Cuban-Americans said they were willing to form human blockades and even lay down their lives if necessary to keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States .",
