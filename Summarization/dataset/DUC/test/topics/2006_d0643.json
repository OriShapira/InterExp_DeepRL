            "While that theory had been challenged , the find appears to support at least his claim that the lull occurred .",

            "LONDON , April 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate , the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean , scientists suggested Thursday .",
            "Richard Feely and colleagues form the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) have found that during the El Nino years between 1991 and 1994 , the release of carbon dioxide from equatorial Pacific Ocean was between 30 and 80 percent of that in 1996 , a non-El Nino year .",
            "`` El Nino clearly has a marked influence on the overall carbon dioxide flux , '' the researchers wrote in a letter to the British science journal Nature .",
            "The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year .",
            "Areas where water is sinking absorb the gas , those where water is rising to the surface release the gas .",
            "The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial Pacific , where is also the home of El Nino , the quasi-biennial warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean .",

            "It 's clear that from decade to decade the nature of El Nino does change .",

            "Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years .",
            "One of the most startling things they 've found is the ability of the ocean to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then stay that way for thousands of years .",

            "That 's the conclusion of climatologist Stanley A. Changnon , who calculated that while the 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 deaths , it also can be credited with preserving 850 lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons .",
            "And its $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.5 billion in damage is far outweighed by nearly $ 20 billion in benefits , Changnon reports in the September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society .",
            "`` If you treat it as an economic outcome for the country ... most of the country benefited , '' Changnon said .",
            "True , the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and , by some , for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast .",
            "But it also produced an exceptionally mild winter in most of the Northern states and blocked Atlantic Coast hurricanes .",
            "`` I figured , just watching what was happening , that it was going to be a zero-sum game but it turned out far from that , '' Changnon said in a telephone interview from his Mahomet , Ill. , home .",
            "Michael Glantz , an El Nino expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado , was skeptical .",

            "`` I 'm wary of trying to cost out weather events . ''",
            "In his paper , Changnon admitted there could be up to a 30 percent variation in the costs and benefits cited , but noted that would still produce considerably more benefit than loss .",

            "It , too , can affect the world 's weather .",
            "La Ninas sometimes occur between El Ninos .",
            "According to Changnon , as few as 100 people died in winter cold and storms during the 1997-98 El Nino , well below the average of 850 in recent years .",
            "Generally mild temperatures `` greatly reduced lives lost to extreme cold , '' Changnon wrote , and there also were fewer weather-related auto accidents and deaths in winter storms .",
            "`` El Nino 's influence on the atmosphere led to the elimination of major Atlantic hurricanes during 1997 , '' he added .",
            "That meant no lives lost compared to the average of 20 in recent years and it meant an enormous savings for home and business owners , governments and insurers .",
            "The mild temperatures also saved businesses and homeowners millions of dollars they did n't have to spend on heating fuel , Changnon said , though that also can be calculated as a loss for utilities .",
            "Lack of demand for heating fuel made oil a glut on the market , resulting in the price of gasoline dropping to as low as 80 cents a gallon in some parts of the country , O'Brien pointed out .",
            "In addition to the economic benefits of the mild winter , Changnon reported , `` Thousands went out of doors more , millions went shopping , many altered their types of recreation , and almost everyone enjoyed better health than in normal winters . ''",

            "For many parts of the Americas and Asia , the occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in , usually with little warning , then staying for months or sometimes a year or two , bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts , heat and cold .",
            "Now , after a record El Nino in 1997 and 1998 , followed almost immediately by a prolonged La Nina , the tropical Pacific has shaken off its fever and chills and is expected for at least a year to be `` normal . ''",
            "So one might think meteorologists could relax a bit .",
            "But it is exactly the opposite , many of them say .",
            "Now they are sweating .",
            "With no El Nino or La Nina , there is no sheep dog driving the sheep , no strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow of weather across the seas and continents .",
            "As a result , long-term forecasts _ the ones that help determine the price of oil or natural gas futures , the ones that determine how much road salt your town buys this fall _ are looking a bit like guesswork .",
            "`` Over the last three years , a lot of people have looked pretty sharp , '' said Dr. William C. Patzert , a research oceanographer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. `` Now the going gets tough . ''",
            "Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina .",
            "They have still not found a way to predict when one or the other will develop .",
            "For example , the El Nino that formed in 1997 and boosted global temperatures to record highs was unanticipated , as was its intensity .",
            "But once one of the conditions settles into place , meteorologists have become adept at predicting the consequences and incorporating those patterns into long-term forecasts .",
            "Normally , Patzert said , the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific varies only a few degrees Fahrenheit through the course of a year .",
            "An El Nino can raise surface temperatures 14 degrees above normal over an area three times the size of the contiguous United States .",
            "A La Nina can drop it nearly 8 degrees .",
            "More heat causes more evaporation and more rising hot air , meaning more storms .",
            "Cooler temperatures , Patzert said , create the equivalent `` of a stone in a stream , '' nudging storm tracks and the jet stream out of place .",
            "El Nino has been linked to strong winter storms that batter southern California , to a weak hurricane season in the Atlantic as high-altitude winds shear the towering tops from developing tropical storms , to searing droughts in southern Asia like the one that spawned enormous rain forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 .",
            "A La Nina , among other things , seems to nurture Atlantic hurricanes , push the North American winter storm track further north , and bring heat and drought to the West .",
            "Without either , weather becomes typical _ meaning largely unpredictable _ meteorologists say .",
            "The government 's long-term forecast maps for this winter retreat largely to what meteorologists call `` climatology '' _ essentially a tossup _ with most of North America given an even chance of having below average , above average , or average temperatures .",
            "Precipitation charts are a little less equivocal , but only a little .",
            "To point out just how fuzzy things will be in coming months , Dr. Tim P. Barnett , a marine physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego , described government predictions for his home town : `` For San Diego this winter , indicators range from extremely heavy precipitation to very dry , with all categories equally likely . ''",
            "He said meteorologists , if they are prudent , will likely include strong caveats in any long-term forecasts in the coming months .",
            "`` You just have to say that 's the way it is , '' Barnett said .",
            "Without anything driving the system , he added , `` the atmosphere tends to be its wonderful chaotic normal self , and that makes forecasting very difficult . ''",
            "There are signs that this may not always be the case .",
            "Dr. John O .",
            "Roads , the director of the experimental climate prediction center at Scripps , said that new work is showing that there are plenty of other subtle influences on long-term weather that should eventually improve predictions , even in years without the strong influence from the Pacific .",
            "He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns , adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success .",
            "But it will be years before these forces are incorporated in official forecasts issued by federal climate prediction centers , he said .",
            "One place where the frontier of forecasting is already being pushed is at private forecasting companies whose predictions are sold to commodities traders , utilities , or other customers whose business relies on anticipating future weather .",
            "To prosper , these companies have to offer a product that is better than the government 's forecasts .",
            "A false move can make or break a trader trying to anticipate the price of winter wheat or heating oil or natural gas , said Drew Lerner , a meteorologist for Bridge Global Weather Services , a private forecasting company in Overland , Kan .",

            "`` You take all these things and try to put it all together , '' he said .",
            "Among his predictions for this winter are a lack of strong storms along the Atlantic coast , colder than normal temperatures in the northern Plains and Great Lakes region , and abundant January precipitation from the lower Middle West to the mid-Atlantic seaboard .",

            "LONDON ( AP ) -- After linking El Nino with illnesses such as malaria , cholera and dengue fever , scientists now have connected the climatic phenomenon with an increase in childhood diarrhea .",
            "The research led by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health also suggests for the first time that gradual temperature increases related to global warming could foster outbreaks of diarrhea in children living in developing nations .",
            "Diarrhea kills as many as 3 million children under the age of 5 worldwide every year and sickens millions more , mostly in developing countries .",
            "It normally is more prevalent during the warmer seasons but , until now , experts did n't know whether a change in temperature could play a role .",
            "The study of 57,331 children in Lima , Peru , found that an increase in diarrhea cases between 1993 and 1997 was linked to even small rises in temperature , regardless of whether it was summer or winter .",
            "In fact , the effect was greater in winter , even though the weather was cooler .",
            "Overall , the study , published this week in The Lancet medical journal , found that for every 1 degree centigrade ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) hotter than normal it became , 8 percent more children arrived at a local clinic for treatment of diarrhea .",
            "The findings were similar for the 1997-1998 El Nino period .",
            "The number of children brought to the clinic each day that winter was double what would have been expected for that time of year had El Nino not occurred , the study found .",
            "El Nino , which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up , creating unusual weather patterns around the world , increased winter temperatures in Lima by about 4 degrees centigrade ( about 7 degrees Fahrenheit ) .",
            "A similar increase in temperatures brought on by El Nino in the summer was still connected to more diarrhea than usual , but the effect was not as strong , accounting for only a 50 percent rise in diarrhea cases , the researchers found .",
            "`` The potential effect of global warming on disease is controversial , '' said William Checkley of Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins , who led the study .",
            "`` This study suggests there may be something to it for diarrhea . ''",
            "It 's plausible the researchers ' findings could apply in countries other than Peru , said Dr. Tony McMichael , an epidemiology professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who studies the effects of climate on disease .",
            "`` In general , a large proportion of infectious disease agents are very sensitive to slight changes in climate , '' said McMichael , who was not involved in the research .",
            "`` This would give us a reasonable indication of how diarrhea agents react to changes in temperature in general , whether in water or in food . ''",
            "Checkley said the stronger effect in winter could be due to the fact that the types of diarrhea common in winter and summer are different .",
            "In hot weather , diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is more likely .",
            "Cooler temperatures appear to enhance the transmission of viral diarrhea , he said .",
            "When the winters are hotter than normal , it could be that children are exposed to more sources of diarrhea , including the bacterial and parasite sort .",
