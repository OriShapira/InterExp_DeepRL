            "HOUSTON _ To prevent school violence , suburban and rural school districts should consider some measures used by their urban counterparts , experts and educators say .",
            "None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban schools .",
            "Experts say that 's probably because they stress such prevention measures as metal detectors , increased security , school uniforms , parental involvement , alternative schools and conflict-resolution programs .",
            "`` In the case of suburban school districts , they have n't had to think about this , '' said Joanne McDaniel , research director for the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh , N.C. And it does n't help , she said , when school districts that have n't had to deal with serious violence ignore the multifaceted problems that lead to incidents such as the murders of 15 students Tuesday attack in Littleton , Col .",
            "Many schools are n't taking day-to-day security measures , such as requiring students to wear school uniforms .",
            "`` More than 70 percent of our schools require uniforms , which make it hard to hide a weapon and prevent the wearing of gang-related clothing , '' said Terry Abbott , Houston Independent School District spokesman .",
            "Whether real or perceived , violence in the nation 's schools has been an issue of concern , research and debate for more than two decades .",
            "When school shootings such as the ones that occurred in Colorado , Mississippi , Kentucky , Arkansas and Oregon happen , some districts look , listen and search for ways not to become the next Littleton .",
            "In the Fort Bend Independent School District southwest of Houston , administrators such as Mary Ann Simpson , the associate superintendent for community relations , are watching the TV coverage from Colorado .",
            "`` Short of turning our schools into prisons , there is no 100 percent guarantee that you can eliminate this kind of thing , '' she said .",
            "`` But you can certainly look for ways to strengthen and improve what you have in place ... and listen to our kids , talk to our kids , especially those that seem isolated . ''",
            "Fort Bend does n't have metal detectors in its schools but does have district police officers at middle and high school campuses , video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators .",
            "Tonya Aultman-Bettridge , a researcher with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence in Boulder , Colo. , is n't sure the school shootings in Littleton could have been prevented with better or more security measures .",
            "She believes school climate is more of a deterrent than metal detectors .",
            "`` I do n't think installing metal detectors and having armed police officers roaming the halls is the solution , '' she said .",
            "`` We concentrate a lot on teaching kids math and science , and we do n't integrate things like violence prevention into the curriculum . ''",
            "She suggested that districts foster an environment where violent behavior is unacceptable ; teach students social skills such as anger management and empathy ; and create a crisis plan and build partnerships between schools , law enforcement , social services , parents and the community .",
            "`` Schools do n't exist by themselves , '' Aultman-Bettridge said .",
            "McDaniel noted that the majority of the nation 's schools continue to be safe places free of violent incidents .",
            "`` We are still talking small numbers , '' she said .",
            "`` But we are talking serious rage , and we need to get to know our young people so that when they are feeling rage we can act to help , not just react . ''",

            "Since two teen-agers at Columbine High School killed twelve other students , a teacher and themselves in Littleton , Colo. , on April 20 , 1999 , some critics have said that schools have taken zero-tolerance discipline policies to the extreme .",

            "Jane Hammond , the Jefferson County ( Colo. ) superintendent whose district includes Columbine , said one of the most important lessons she learned from the tragedy was that student safety is n't a sure thing .",

            "Just such an event happened Thursday in Conyers , Ga. , 25 miles east of Atlanta , where a 15-year-old sophomore who reportedly had recently broken up with his girlfriend shot six fellow students then surrendered his gun and cried .",
            "None of the injuries appeared life-threatening .",
            "Coming on the one-month anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings that ended 15 lives , the incident reinforced the growing _ some would say exaggerated _ perception that schools must now be considered danger zones .",
            "Before Thursday 's shootings , those fears had been fueled primarily by a rash of bomb threats that emptied schools and attracted widespread media attention , which by some accounts created a cycle of even more copycat threats .",
            "Before Columbine _ where the two killers came armed with more than 50 explosives _ school bomb threats were usually ignored by the media in the belief that publicizing such events only encourages more .",
            "There is no way to tell whether such threats have increased since the April 20 massacre , or whether the public is simply learning how frequently they occur .",
            "But authorities on school violence said Thursday that the perception of greater risk seems to reflect a troubling reality .",

            "Schools around the country have considered using the Ten Commandments as a symbol of morality amid headline-grabbing violence involving students over the past year .",
            "In the 1960s , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that organized prayer and Bible readings were not permitted in public schools ; in 1980 , it decided posting the Ten Commandments violated the Constitution 's ban of government-established religion .",
            "But in June , the U.S. House passed a measure allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools and other government buildings .",

            "Timothy Crawford , Jackson County 's school district attorney , said he is concerned about lawsuits , but believes the plaques in the district 's five schools are allowed by law because they were paid for and posted by local volunteers and not sponsored by the district .",
            "`` I do not believe posting the Ten Commandments is imposing anyone 's religious views because the kids are not tested on that , the kids are not required to look at it , and the kids are not required to read it , and they 're not held accountable for that knowledge , '' Crawford said .",

            "He said a lawsuit could cost a district up to hundreds of thousands of dollars .",
            "There was virtually no opposition from the community about the plaques , and students returning to the high school said little about them .",
            "`` We have a new dress code this year , and I suspect in the children 's mind that 's much more of a trauma than the Ten Commandments being placed up because this is a very traditional community and really church-oriented , '' Bond said ."
