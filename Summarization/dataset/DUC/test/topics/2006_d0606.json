            "MONTREAL , October 16 ( Xinhua ) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) today called for stronger actions to combat the threat of climate change to wildlife and natural ecosystems .",
            "`` Climate change as a result of global warming represents a serious threat to the survival of biodiversity and the protection , management and rehabilitation of protected areas , '' the WWF reaffirmed .",
            "Governments and international organizations `` have to stop hitting the snooze button on the alarm bell for action that global warming represents , '' said Adam Markham , director of the WWF 's Global Climate Change Campaign .",
            "`` How many ecosystems must be threatened before we listen to this wake-up call ? ''",
            "he asked at a news briefing at the ongoing World Conservation Congress in Montreal , Canada .",
            "Climate changes affecting the planet are caused mainly by the burning of coal , oil and gas .",
            "Huge quantities of pollutants like carbon dioxide trap more and more heat in the atmosphere , ultimately disrupting the global temperature balance .",
            "At the speed the climate is now changing , scientists predict the world will soon be warmer than at any time in the last 10,000 years .",
            "According to a study by some 2,500 scientists of the world , atmospheric concentrations of Co2 are now 30 percent above the pre-industrial level and a warming trend in global mean temperature can be detected since 1860 .",
            "`` Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change , '' the study said .",
            "Climate change is `` getting worse , '' and it has already produced `` severe '' impacts on ecosystems , habitats , species , Markham noted .",
            "In this fight against global warming , Markham emphasized that the industrialized countries should take on more responsibilities and keep their promises of Co2 emission reductions .",
            "He singled out the United States , the world 's biggest producer of green house gas emission , and Canada , the No .",
            "1 country in per capita gas emission .",
            "The two countries produce more than 20 percent of all gas emission worldwide , he said .",
            "If the present level of ecosystem is to be maintained , at least 20 percent of Co2 emission will have to be reduced worldwide , Markham added ."

            "Seven years later , scientists maintain a climate shift was at work .",
            "The deer mouse population boomed prior to the outbreak , according to a study authored by Hjelle , because El Nino-driven rains in 1991-92 increased vegetation , providing food and ground cover .",
            "When conditions turned drier the next year , the mice sought food in homes .",

            "Evidence continues to accumulate that the frozen world of the Arctic and sub-Arctic is thawing , and the findings are spotlighting two increasingly important questions : Can what is happening in the Great White North touch off sudden shifts in climate that will transform weather and disrupt life throughout the Northern Hemisphere ?",
            "Is the Arctic a key to the way in which global warming might be translated into region-by-region climatic changes ?",
            "The answer , many experts believe , may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming .",
            "The theory behind this view holds that the climate of the North Atlantic region , including Europe and eastern North America , is controlled by great ocean currents that transport heat northward from the tropics .",
            "This oceanic conveyor belt is set in motion when saltier , and therefore heavier , surface water sinks to the deep ocean in the vicinity of southern Greenland .",
            "It is replaced by warm water from the tropics that warms the North Atlantic region .",
            "Without it , the relatively mild climate of England , for instance , might be as cold as that of northern Canada .",
            "The worry is that a great influx of fresh water from the thawing Arctic might dilute the salty current and so either halt or weaken the heat-bearing conveyor belt .",
            "This could result in a sudden , long-term drop in the North Atlantic region 's temperature , a climatic disruption that would probably reverberate around the hemisphere by altering large-scale atmospheric circulation .",
            "Last week , scientists reported that the current did indeed weaken or stop at least twice in the past , plunging the region , which each time had been warming , into cold comparable to that of an ice age .",
            "Other researchers , focusing on the present , last week produced the latest in a lengthening string of studies documenting the thawing of the vast sheet of ice that covers the far northern seas , a potential source of fresh water that , once it melts , could help weaken the heat conveyor .",
            "A third research group , using computerized simulations of the ocean-atmosphere system , concluded that the present-day thawing of Northern Hemisphere sea ice could not be explained by natural causes .",
            "The most obvious possible cause , they said , is global warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide , which result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal , oil and natural gas .",
            "And they said the rate of sea-ice melting was likely to increase in the decades ahead if emissions of the heat-trapping gases continued at today 's rates .",
            "Sudden influxes of fresh water from the Arctic appear to have shut down or weakened the oceanic heat conveyor twice in the relatively recent geological past , according to a study reported in the current issue of Nature by Dr. Carsten Ruhlemann of the University of Bremen , Germany , and colleagues .",
            "By examining chemical clues in ocean sediments , they determined that in each case , the western tropical North Atlantic was relatively warm while waters farther north were relatively cold _ as would be expected if the conveyor stopped or weakened .",
            "The apparent shutdowns occurred as the world was coming out of the last ice age .",
            "The North Atlantic region 's rebound was twice interrupted by sudden reversions to glacial conditions , once around 15,000 years ago and again around 12,000 years ago , before settling into the relative warmth that has prevailed for the last 10,000 years .",
            "The first reversion to glacial cold coincided with an invasion of the North Atlantic by vast quantities of fresh water in the form of icebergs , which were released from North America as temperatures warmed .",

            "nn In another , reported in the current issue of the journal Science , researchers led by Dr. Ola M. Johannessen of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen , Norway , used satellite data to measure the area of the Arctic ice sheet .",
            "They found that the perennial ice cover had shrunk by 14 percent over the last two decades .",
            "The third study , by nine researchers headed by Dr. Konstantin Y. Vinnikov of the University of Maryland , analyzed data from five different sources and found that sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole had decreased by about 7 percent in the last 46 years .",
            "Computer models of the ocean-atmosphere system reconstructed this trend accurately , said Dr. Alan Robock of Rutgers University , a member of the research team .",
            "The model simulations also determined that the trend was much larger than what would be expected to result from the climate system 's natural variability .",
            "This assumes that the models can reproduce natural variability with some accuracy , an assumption that many experts question .",
            "Nevertheless , Robock said , the study provides `` strong support for the theory that humans are causing the climate to change . ''",
            "If the climate is indeed warming because of human activity , many scientists say , the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic could increase .",
            "Melting ice in the Arctic is not the only potential contributor .",
            "Water from melting glaciers in Greenland and other Arctic and sub-arctic islands could also contribute .",
            "Last year , scientists reported that the southern half of the Greenland ice cap was melting back by about two cubic miles a year , enough to cover Maryland with a sheet 1 foot thick .",

            "Melting sea ice does not ; like an ice cube in a glass of water , its change in state does not raise the water level . )",
            "A third contributor to an influx of fresh water could be increased precipitation .",
            "A warmer atmosphere causes more water to evaporate from the oceans , and some scientists believe that some of this increased atmospheric moisture would be transported to the far north , where it would produce a heavier runoff of fresh water into the North Atlantic .",
            "This alone , some computer models indicate , would be enough to weaken the North Atlantic heat conveyor drastically in the 21st century .",
            "How much fresh water might be necessary to halt , slow or weaken the conveyor is a crucial question that scientists can not yet answer .",
            "Nor do they know how close the world might be to an abrupt change in the conveyor 's behavior .",

            "Schlosser and others say the magnitude of the resulting climate change might be different from those observed in the last glacial cycle .",
            "But , he said , `` It might put the system into a state that might be a precondition for further change . ''",
            "What might such a change entail ?",

            "The fund , known in the United States as the World Wildlife Fund , paints a devastating picture of the ability of species from Arctic polar bears and walruses , to New England sugar maple trees , to survive unless they can migrate quickly and adapt to their new environment .",

Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres , beginning as early as the next century , a new scientific study predicted recently .",
            "Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans , Michael Oppenheimer , chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund , made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet .",
            "In two of the three scenarios , complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres , causing major coastal flooding worldwide , Oppenheimer wrote in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature . '",
            "In the other scenario , the internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting to slow down .",
            "With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole , the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a large sea-level rise , owing to its potential instability , '' Oppenheimer said .",
            "Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet , as early as next century , he said .",
            "The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration .",
            "Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal , gas and oil , are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth 's surface and a change in the global climate .",
            "In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the United Nations on the issue , predicted that the average global temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius during the next century .",
            "Last year , scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record , and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature .",
            "Over time , these increases could cause changes in climate , including the increased frequency and intensity of storms , floods , heat waves , and droughts , the scientists said .",
            "To deal with this threat 38 industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in Kyoto , Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012 .",
            "While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse ' or melting . '",
            "But Oppenheimer warned that , as countries begin to formulate global warming policies , 'the potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large and irreversible '' to be considered at a later date .",
            "Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue , Oppenheimer said .",
            "Until recently , scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting .",
            "Similarly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all .",
            "Yet , recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating ice , he added .",
            "In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs , these new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .",
            "Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades , possibly because of local atmospheric warming .",
            "While most scientists agreed that the ice sheet was shrinking , they disagreed on how fast it will melt and what the consequences would be .",
            "In an effort to simplify the controversy , Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice .",
            "Each of the three most likely possibilities varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice shelves in the area .",
            "Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions , Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres .",
            "While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the twenty-first century for several hundreds of years , the process could begin in as early as 50 years .",
            "Some reports said the process already had begun .",
