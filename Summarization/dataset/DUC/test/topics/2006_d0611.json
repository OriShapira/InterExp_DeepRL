            "BUFFALO , N.Y. ( AP ) - For the first 15 years of their farming lives , Gail and Mike Thorpe of East Aurora relied on a conventional arsenal of pesticides and fertilizers to grow their fields of fruits and vegetables .",
            "But for the last three years , the couple has scrapped chemicals in favor of things like tricho gamma wasps , green lace wings , bars of soap , live bacteria , and lots of weeding .",
            "The Thorpes have gone organic .",
            "''It 's been like learning to farm all over again , '' said Gail Thorpe .",
            "''But it has been worth it .",
            "We feel really good about what 's coming out of our fields . ''",
            "This past week that feeling was backed by an official designation of their accomplishments .",
            "The Thorpes passed a final inspection by the Northeastern Organic Farming Association/New York Chapter , and have the right to claim 896 acres of their farm as `` certified organic . ''",
            "These local farmers are part of a growing national trend of organic farming , joining more than 6,000 other growers of everything from fruits and vegetables to animal feeds and food-grade soy beans .",
            "Nationally , the organic head count is up 20 percent in two years .",
            "In New York , more than 230 growers have earned official organic status , with another 50 or so expected to pass muster this growing season .",
            "Although less than 2 percent of all food produced in the U.S. is certified organic , annual sales now total more than $ 6 billion said Sarah Johnston , executive director of the New York branch of the organic farming association .",
            "''Our farmers are still the little guys , but we 're seeing a steady growth trend as consumer demand grows and producer awareness increases , '' she said .",
            "By definition , organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers and pesticides , instead harnessing the power of natural substances , such as compost , bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective netting , to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay .",
            "While any farmer can opt to use these methods , those who want to label the fruits of their labors as `` certified organic , '' are required to go through a three-year process that includes extensive documentation .",
            "While the ranks of organic farmers are steadily increasing , it 's still considered an oddity .",
            "Steve Porter , in his 11th year of organic growing , is the state 's largest organic vegetable producer .",
            "He said he continues to be scrutinized by non-organic neighbors .",
            "''We 're still considered the weird ones , '' Porter said of the Elba farm he runs with his father , Jack , and brother , Bill .",
            "'' A lot of them scratch their heads , but a few are getting interested in how this works . ''",
            "While other farmers were writing checks for annual applications of herbicides , pesticides and fertilizers , the Porters have faced higher upfront costs on soil preparation , including equipment , organic substances and labor .",
            "''The costs probably work out to be comparable , but they 're paying and applying chemicals several times a year , every year , while our biggest costs are up front , '' Porter said .",
            "Over the past decade , the Porters have seen their organic business bloom from a one-acre vegetable patch to more than 500 acres of produce .",
            "The goods find their way to the table via Wegmans and Tops supermarkets , health food stores , food cooperatives , natural foods wholesalers , and the farm 's own Community Supported Agriculture program .",
            "Through the CSA program , participants pay up front for a season 's worth of produce , and receive weekly installments of fruits and vegetables from early summer through early winter .",
            "More than 160 families in the Buffalo and Rochester areas are currently paying about $ 200 each for the steady supply of organically-grown goods .",
            "The Porters also produce organic grains sold to organic dairy farmers as feed , and raise food-grade organic soy beans to ship around the world for tofu production .",
            "While declining to discuss profits , Porter said he has n't had to `` run to the bank to borrow money . ''",
            "''You do n't go into farming to get rich , '' he said .",
            "''We 're holding our own financially , expanding our acreage and finding new markets , so I guess we 're a success . ''"

            "WASHINGTON , Va. _ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farms is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated .",
            "Workers advance upon windowless structures on wheels that are scattered around the 539 acres and lower the sides , releasing thousands of clucking chickens eager for a good day 's work at what they do best : eating bugs .",
            "David Cole , venture capitalist , philanthropist and organic farmer , uses these coops on wheels _ chicken mobile units , they 're called _ to move his chickens where the pecking is needed most .",
            "The mobile units are just one of many labor-savers he employs on the organic farm he started in 1995 in the middle of Rappahannock County , home to the very rich who have made their money elsewhere and to farmers who barely make a living .",
            "Like the cattle , sheep and goats that keep the pasture trimmed , the chickens take care of fertilizing it .",
            "Like every aspect of his $ 11.5 million farm , the mobile units are state-of-the-art equipment intended to ensure the success of his experimental farm .",
            "Money is no object , and money is not the only objective .",
            "The farm is not a rich man 's hobby .",
            "It is a rich man 's business , and Cole , who made his name as president of Internet services at America Online ( and his money in a variety of other computer technology businesses ) , predicts confidently that Sunnyside will turn a profit by 2004 .",
            "In addition to its wagonloads of chickens , the farm has 424 head of Wagyu cattle ( close relatives of the famous Japanese Kobe beef ) ; 60 to 70 varieties of vegetables , herbs and flowers ; and 8 to 10 varieties of berries , as well as pear , apple and cherry trees .",
            "It is experimenting with more than 200 kinds of fruits and vegetables .",
            "But even more important to Cole is Sunnyside 's role in promoting organic farming as economic savior .",
            "By helping local growers profit in an era when independent farms are struggling , he hopes to create a model for reviving depressed agricultural areas around the country .",
            "The idea of saving a region through organic farming might once have sounded outlandish .",
            "But the demand for organic food nationwide is greater than the supply , and sales have increased by at least 20 percent annually for several years .",
            "Buyers looking for such food _ independently certified to be free of chemical pesticides , genetically engineered ingredients and antibiotics _ willingly pay a premium for it .",
            "Cole , 47 , calls his system network farming : a large central farm is the hub , with smaller nearby farms the spokes , their production marketed through the hub .",
            "Sunnyside 's system is designed to show that diversified organic farming , with a mix of vegetables , fruits and animals , can be profitable while protecting the environment , not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by traditional farming methods .",
            "Such a system would be particularly useful in helping small organic farmers compete .",
            "The concept is not new .",
            "Walnut Acres Organic Farms in Pennsylvania , which Cole just bought , operates in the same fashion .",
            "But Sunnyside was set up to be an experimental demonstration farm .",
            "`` What he is doing is really rare , '' said Katherine DiMatteo , executive director of the Organic Trade Association .",
            "`` That he has the ability to have this diversity on his farm makes it unique .",
            "It totally encompasses the breadth of on-farm innovation and research .",
            "He is really taking new and old ideas and combining all that information into a full farm approach . ''",
            "So far three small farms have signed on with Sunnyside , and conversations with a dozen more farmers are under way .",
            "The farm pays to educate them in converting to organic techniques and gaining organic certification and gives them access to the expensive equipment needed to run an organic farm .",
            "It also pays them 20 to 30 percent more than they would get if they were selling conventional food and , more important , gets their products to consumers .",
            "`` A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing , '' said Brian Cramer , the gardener and orchard production manager at Sunnyside .",
            "Selling at farmers ' markets or farm stands , with no middlemen , `` is always preferable , '' he said , `` but some farmers do n't want to do it . ''",
            "`` Some do n't have time to do it , '' he said , `` so they leave it to someone else , and they get taken advantage of . ''",
            "nn In the summer Sunnyside is opening a market in an 1835 building Cole is restoring in the center of the tiny town of Washington , Va. , less than a block from his most prestigious customer , the Inn at Little Washington .",
            "Its farmers ' products will be sold there , at a farmers ' market in Washington , D.C. , and to restaurants , the Fresh Fields natural supermarket chain and an organic wholesaler who sells up and down the East Coast .",
            "There will be more than 30 varieties of tomatoes , 15 different peppers and three dozen kinds of greens .",
            "`` Eventually we could have 8 or 10 spoke farms , and that could have a tremendous economic impact on the community , '' said Cole , who has restored the 1720 house on the farm , one of several places he lives with his wife of 30 years and the youngest of their four children .",
            "( One son works for Sunnyside full time , another during the summer . )",
            "The original 1,000-acre farm had been in the same family for 276 years .",
            "When Cole bought half of it , in 1995 , the land had been worn out by conventional farming .",
            "It took two years of intensive working and enriching the soil for the first earthworms to return , and Sunnyside was certified organic in 1999 .",
            "DiMatteo , of the Organic Trade Association , said she doubts that aylne has ever started an organic farm from scratch on so grand a scale , and while she greatly admires what Cole is trying to do , she is not certain it will succeed .",
            "`` People either go into organic farming gradually or specialize in one crop while they figure out crop rotations , '' she said .",
            "`` Wealthy people do organic farming , but profitability is not what it 's about , and he 's setting a goal of a working farm that is economically feasible .",
            "`` This is the food industry .",
            "It 's not like the technology industry .",
            "You ca n't force nature to perform according to some bottom-line expectations . ''",
            "John Burns , a consultant who was hired by Cole in 1995 but left after a falling-out two years later , agreed .",
            "`` When there is such an excess amount of capital around , '' he said , `` the solution seems to be spend more money , get more people and get more equipment , as opposed to scaling back and concentrating on fewer things .",
            "It 's the mentality of his other enterprises : you get enough brain power and enough people and you can get it solved , and farming is n't that way .",
            "It 's the cycle of life and nature ; it 's not microchip speed . ''",
            "Cole , though , maintains that with enough money and his successful business experience he can help nature along .",
            "For instance , his recent purchase of Walnut Acres , the oldest organic food mail order company in the country , provides Sunnyside with built-in marketing advantages .",
            "He has also scoured the country for the best people in organic production , like Wes Beall , a cow 's version of the horse whisperer : cattle trust him .",
            "To assure a steady supply of loyal farmworkers , who are recruited from two villages in Mexico , Cole provides benefits including trips home for two or three months at a time and 401 ( k ) plans , matching the workers ' contributions .",
            "Cole has also planted several varieties of dwarf fruit stock to see which grow best .",
            "These varieties , Cramer said , bear more fruit more quickly , and are easier to pick and to spray with organic pest controls .",
            "Many are heirloom varieties like Roxbury Russet and Grimes Golden apples and newer varieties like Liberty that are immune to a serious apple disease called scab .",
            "Sunnyside has its own weather station .",
            "It alerts the orchardist when to expect an outbreak of pests and prepare for it .",
            "For example , it can pinpoint the moment when the Japanese beetle 's larvae are about to emerge .",
            "While the commercial grower is bringing out the pesticides , Cole is sending out the chickens .",
            "The farm uses animals in an intensive grazing rotation , a technique now being reintroduced into organic agriculture .",
            "`` In order to save human labor we enlist animal labor , '' Cole said , `` by having them do what they do naturally . ''",
            "For a day or two cattle graze on high grasses in a particular field ; when they move on , the sheep and goats come in for a day to eat everything else .",
            "They are followed by the chickens , which scatter the manure left behind by the other animals as they eat the weed seeds out of it , at the same time depositing their own nitrogen-rich manure .",
            "( The chickens also provide eggs for the farm to sell . )",
            "Then the rotation begins again .",
            "All of these approaches will be shared at the Sunnyside Institute , to be built on the farm .",
            "It will provide information not available from federal and state agriculture agencies , which have spent little time or money studying organic farming .",
            "`` No one has ever coordinated all this information , '' DiMatteo said .",
            "Cole traces his interest in the environment to his childhood in Hawaii .",
            "His family has financed global conservation efforts for 15 years , most recently through the Cole Family Foundation .",
            "He chose Virginia for his experiment because of its climate and its proximity to one of his homes .",
            "He found the farm through his friend and now neighbor , John Sawhill , president and chief executive of the environmental group the Nature Conservancy .",
            "In an interview for `` Dream Makers , '' by Michele Hunt ( Davies-Black Publishing , 1998 ) , Cole said entrepreneurs need to redefine capital to include not only money but the earth itself and stop treating it like an unlimited resource .",
            "`` Instead of saying the world is going to hell in a handbasket , you have to say we can do something about this .",
            "We can change our relationship to the earth . ''",
            "Like any rich mogul who comes to town and buys up all the available land , Cole has his detractors .",
            "But even those who have parted ways over differences of opinion admire what he is trying to do .",
            "Burns , who quit as a consultant , said Cole is `` brilliant . ''",
            "But he added : `` He makes it hard for some people to deal with him , because you have to do it his way .",
            "He wants to do too much too fast .",
            "If I 'd had my druthers , I would have managed the farm for three years without growing a thing , but he wanted to have crops in 18 months . ''",
            "In early April , Cole was invited to lecture at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London on organic food trends in the United States .",
            "In his speech he described his attempt to fuse two totally different cultures : the high-powered , fast-paced world of technology and marketing and a slow-paced place from the past where success is based on the production yields of organic farming .",
            "Cole leaves no doubt of his certitude that he can apply the principles of the Internet , where rewards can come at warp speed and most problems can be remedied with brain power and capital , to farming , where even the best-laid plans are subject to the vagaries of nature .",
            "`` He wants to do good , and he really sees this as an important step , '' Burns said .",
            "`` And being a leader in a previous industrial incarnation , he wants to do the same thing in the organic world .",
            "But organic mogul may be an oxymoron . ''"

            "The hunters will line up five-to-10 feet apart and walk forward in tandem along the fairways , stopping at intervals to pull up small sections of ground and examine them for grubs before replacing them .",

            "LONDON _ Exchanging their confines for a temporary stay in the open country air , seven prisoners from Her Majesty 's Prison Leyhill in the Cotswolds won their second gold medal last week at the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show , the Royal Horticultural Society 's summer extravaganza .",
            "Their show garden , `` Take a Walk on the Wild Side , '' included a woodland garden of wildflowers and grasses under linden and beech trees , with a stream flowing under a stone bridge .",
            "`` It is one thing to make a garden , and another to mimic nature , '' Adrian Foulkes , a prisoner , said of the difficulty of forcing bluebells and wild garlic into bloom .",
            "Foulkes , who is 39 and is nearing parole on a life sentence for murder , heads the prison 's garden committee this year .",
            "The flower show , which ended last weekend , is an annual event on the grounds of Hampton Court Palace , in the London borough of Richmond-Upon-Thames , on the Thames River .",
            "The show , which attracts horticultural groups and garden designers , uses displays that are designed so that visitors can walk through them .",
            "The prisoners ' exhibit , situated on the banks of a long canal with spouting fountains , seemed like a real woodland in which one could rest on a willow seat under linden trees .",
            "The Hampton Court prize also honored the prisoners ' vegetable garden display : a kitchen garden ( carrots , onions , parsnips and runner beans ) enclosed by cordoned apple and pear trees and a rusty fence overgrown with blackberry bushes from the prison 's grounds .",
            "The kitchen and woodland gardens were designed by Gareth Goundrill _ not a prisoner , but the 18-year-old son of Jeff Goundrill , who oversees business enterprises at Leyhill .",
            "The younger Goundrill made the designs as his final exam for a high school technology course , and the prisoners dug the grounds and planted the flowers , vegetables and trees with the help of the prison farm foreman , Martin Brookes .",
            "Leyhill , a minimum-security institution , has been participating in Royal Horticultural Society flower shows at Hampton Court Palace and Chelsea since 1991 .",
            "`` It is a real pleasure to work with the Leyhill team , '' said Stephen Bennett , the director of the shows .",
            "`` They have become good friends ; they provide much pleasure to the gardening public , and their skillful use of plants _ all grown at the prison _ makes a valuable contribution to horticulture and the community . ''",
            "Leyhill is in the town of Wotton-Under-Edge in the Cotswolds , one of England 's best-known garden belts , about 100 miles west of London .",
            "The institution , on about 250 acres , with three acres under glass , is surrounded by crumbling stone walls .",
            "`` In order to work as a gardener , '' said Tom Williams , the prison 's warden , `` a prisoner needs no horticultural experience .",
            "But he must be quick to learn , work hard and have a sense of humor under pressure . ''",
            "Leyhill 's grounds include an arboretum with more than 1,000 specimen trees and a stately home , Tortworth Court , a 60-room mansion that was built in 1853 and is the former seat of the Earls of Ducie .",
            "Henry John , the third earl , created the arboretum from 1853 to 1921 .",
            "The arboretum has been managed by Leyhill since the prison acquired it in the 1940s .",
            "Leyhill also maintains pasture land for raising rare Gloucester cattle and runs a museum of old farm machinery in the prison 's Tortworth Visitors ' Center , which also includes a farm stand .",
            "The arboretum is open to the public on weekends and bank holidays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m .",

            "The prison 's gardens have become a serious moneymaking enterprise over the last five years .",
            "This year , Leyhill has supplied a million carpet-bedding plants to nearby towns , and it distributes organically grown vegetables to 27 other prisons .",
            "`` If a prison serves a bad meal , it sours the whole atmosphere , '' said Colin Lennox , the farm manager .",
            "And the prison takes the word `` organic '' seriously .",
            "Pests are controlled by their natural predators instead of by sprays and pesticides .",
            "A computer monitors the prison 's nine greenhouses along with irrigation and fertilization .",
            "There 's an additional enterprise for the Leyhill gardens : They provide organic salads and sandwich fillings for British Airways Concorde flights originating at Heathrow Airport .",
            "For all the efficiency of the prison 's garden operation , there is one drawback : As Jeff Goundrill said , `` The best gardeners are always being released . ''"

            "One of the best things to happen to salads in decades is that zippy Italian green called arugula .",
            "It 's literally a weed in Italy , and it would grow just as easily in anybody 's garden if not for one tiny problem : the flea beetle .",
            "Flea beetles are minuscule black insects that appear early in the spring and spend the rest of the season leaping among the plants , chewing holes in leaves .",
            "They hop like fleas , hence the common name .",
            "If there are enough of them , they can nibble seedlings to the ground .",
            "Actually , there are several species of flea beetles .",
            "Some prefer nightshade family plants like eggplant and tomatoes , and some prefer cabbage family plants like broccoli and arugula .",
            "In my garden , the cabbage-eaters are more numerous , and they adore arugula .",
            "If I sow arugula seeds in early spring , to take advantage of the cool weather they like , I have to swathe the spot in one of those diaphanous row covers immediately , before the seeds germinate .",
            "If I do n't , the flea beetles will chomp the seedlings into oblivion the moment the first leaves peek above the surface .",
            "Even so , the flea beetles know the arugula is there .",
            "They alight on the protective cover , patiently waiting for me to lift it to snag a bunch of arugula , so they can sneak in and start munching .",
            "I imagine saliva dripping from their little jaws .",
            "It is no comfort to know that this pest is an accidental import , like the European corn borer , the Japanese beetle and the gypsy moth .",
            "Flea beetles are thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s , probably from Europe or Asia .",
            "They got off the boat in British Columbia and made their way steadily eastward .",
            "The North American countryside is rich in cabbage family weeds like yellow rocket and winter cress , and the flea beetles flourished .",
            "The tiny terrorists arrived in the Northeast in the 1950s and have spent the last half-century establishing themselves as garden pests , as if anyone needed more of those .",
            "Several mild winters in a row have made the problem even worse by allowing more flea beetles to survive .",
            "What 's a gardener to do ?",
            "At a conference in New Haven this winter , research scientists and organic farmers pondered the perplexing problem of Phyllotreta cruciferae , the cabbage-crunching flea beetle , as well as its nightshade-noshing cousins .",
            "Not much research has been done on the agile insects , because they are not a big problem for conventional vegetable growers .",
            "( Pesticides applied to kill other insects tend to keep flea beetles in check . )",
            "For organic growers and most backyard gardeners , though , they are tough to control .",
            "Like other beetles , they are hard-bodied .",
            "They also bound away at the slightest disturbance .",
            "Those characteristics put them out of reach of most botanical pesticides and even the chemicals commonly available for home use , because the pesticide has to touch the insects to kill them .",
            "Aside from keeping the beetles ' favorite foods under cover , farmers reported trying _ with limited success _ to repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays , planting cabbage family crops among aromatic herbs and vacuuming the insects off their crops with leaf blowers adapted to work in reverse .",
            "Some tried to snare the flea beetles on sticky traps : pieces of white or yellow poster board taped to bamboo sticks and coated with a gooey product called Tangle-Trap .",
            "Flea beetles are attracted to white and yellow , and they paste themselves to the traps in numbers .",
            "Kimberly Stoner , an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven , tried baiting sticky traps with mustard oil , the substance that cabbage-loving flea beetles home in on when they 're looking for their favorite snack plants .",
            "The baited traps worked , perhaps too well .",
            "`` I suspect that they attract many more beetles than they trap , '' she said .",
            "Those tempted to try this at home should be warned that concentrated mustard oil can make eyes water and burn skin .",
            "Repellent sprays , traps and covers are usually enough to keep flea beetles from doing fatal damage to crops like broccoli , turnips and rutabagas , but nothing can keep them from making unattractive holes in leafy greens like arugula and mizuna , a mild Japanese mustard that 's also splendid in salads .",
            "For now , there is only one solution to the flea beetle problem : grow the most vulnerable crops in the fall .",
            "Flea beetles run roughshod over the garden until autumn , when they stop reproducing and start looking for a cozy place to spend the winter _ in the soil , fallen leaves or a grassy spot .",
            "From September until hard freeze , the arugula is pristine .",
            "What do Italians do about flea beetles in the arugula ?",
            "Nothing .",
            "The beetles are n't considered a big problem in Europe , suggesting that they made it to North America unaccompanied by the natural predators that keep them in check in their native lands .",
            "A European study found that up to 90 percent of wintering flea beetles of the arugula-munching variety had been killed by beneficial nematodes , tiny soil-dwelling worms ."

            "I do n't even pretend to understand all this stuff , but I 'm committed because I 've seen the results in my vineyards , '' said Topolos , co-owner of Topolos at Russian River Vineyards near Forestville .",
            "He said yields have increased and grape quality has improved .",
            "Topolos and Benziger , both practical businessmen prominent in the wine industry , are among the practitioners of biodynamic agriculture , a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as farming itself along with some New Age spirituality .",
            "Simply stated , biodynamics is an organic farming system that does n't employ pesticides , herbicides or synthetic fertilizers .",
            "Instead , it relies on manure , crop rotations , biological pest control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the ecology surrounding the vineyard .",

            "`` Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine . ''",
            "Biodynamics is so mystical and far-fetched , he said , that it 's not even considered for further research at UC Davis .",
            "It 's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000 of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast .",
            "The percentage is small but with names like Topolos , Benziger and Fetzer involved , this kind of farming is considered more than a fringe movement .",

            "Nationwide , he said , 50 growers have earned biodynamic certification .",
            "Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner , who came up with a system of composting and special preparations that remains the foundation of the biodynamic farming movement .",

            "Before adopting biodynamics two years ago , Benziger had weaned his vineyards from toxic chemicals .",
            "`` The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind , a wine that has sense of place and a uniqueness that can not be duplicated , '' Benziger said .",
            "Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using biodynamic principles .",
            "`` Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment , but is it going to make a better wine ? ''",

            "( STORY CAN END HERE .",
            "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS . )",
            "Biodynamics remains very much an alternative approach to grape growing because it rejects so much of what mainstream viticulture encourages _ chemical pesticides , synthetic fertilizers and routine disking , which disrupts the ecosystem on the vineyard floor .",
            "`` Biodynamics is giving up control over the vines .",
            "The hardest thing with biodynamic farming is not jumping on the tractor and spraying when you see a problem , '' Benziger said .",
            "What raises eyebrows among scientists and conventional growers is biodynamics ' strange practices , such as applying herbal potions by the phases of the moon , spraying microscopic crystals and burying cow dung in a female cow horn .",
            "Greg Willis , the biodynamics consultant at Topolos vineyards , said the buried horns , crystals and moon calendar that are part and parcel of biodynamic farming make the approach difficult for some growers to embrace .",
            "He suggests that farmers get out of their boxes and try something new .",
            "`` We can argue all day about putting a horn in the ground , but we know it works , '' said Willis , owner of a Napa-based consulting business called Agri-Synthesis .",
            "Interest in biodynamics is growing , Beedy said .",
            "`` We are hearing from people that organic farming did n't answer all the questions they had .",
            "They had questions about the unseen quality of life and how to work with the forces of nature , '' he said .",
            "Alan York , a biodynamics expert , manages the vineyards at Jim Fetzer 's Ceago Vinegarden .",
            "He is also advising the Benziger Family Winery as it makes the transition to biodynamics .",
            "Topolos , who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years , said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can fend off insects and diseases .",
            "Believing in the tenets of biodynamics and natural forces _ `` some that we understand and some that we do n't '' _ is key to its success , he said .",
            "The most mystical preparation is made by packing a cow horn with manure and then burying it a foot deep during the fall solstice .",
            "It 's dug up in the spring .",
            "The manure ferments into a sweet-smelling humus-like material _ Topolos calls it black magic _ that is mixed in water and sprayed onto the land .",
            "Topolos agrees that biodynamics requires growers to forget almost everything they have learned and to adopt a new way of thinking .",
            "As both an organic and biodynamic farmer , Topolos said there is some overlap between the two , but that there are real differences .",
            "He said organic farming is more passive .",
            "`` Organic farming is not doing things , '' Topolos said .",
            "`` Biodynamics is quite the opposite .",
            "Not only do we do things , we have to do them on a schedule based on a lunar calendar . ''",

            "You get in trouble when you interfere with their natural cycle and try to make the plants do what & LR ; you & LR ; want , he says .",
            "At the same time , the co-owner of Windward Farming Co. in Salinas explains that he loves strawberry growing because it is not a totally mechanized process but one that allows for much creativity .",
            "In his case , that creativity includes an increasing emphasis on organic farming .",
            "Fresno native Jones , 37 , came up through the farming ranks .",
            "At 16 , he was picking melons in Arizona .",
            "After that he worked as a trucker and an irrigator , among other jobs , eventually ending up in the Salinas Valley strawberry fields in 1982 .",
            "`` I got hooked on strawberries , '' he says with a laugh .",
            "He is also hooked on the valley with its ideal growing conditions created by rich soil and a relatively cool , moderate climate .",
            "Several years ago , he and two partners converted eight of their approximately 125 acres of strawberries to organic , and the results were everything they could have hoped for .",
            "The berries taste and look great , and there is increasing demand for them .",
            "Windward had been moving toward less reliance on chemicals for at least 10 years , reducing pesticide use by as much as 80 percent , Jones says : `` Then we started thinking , if we can control pests organically , why not go all the way ?",
            "( Using fish emulsion and other non-chemical fertilizers ) . ''",
            "Windward Farming now has 22 acres of organic berries and more acreage in transition .",
            "It takes three years to convert from conventional to certified organic status , and therein lies a problem .",
            "Jones and partners , like many small- to medium-size agricultural enterprises in the area , lease their land , typically on a two-year basis .",
            "To go through the conversion process and make it worthwhile , `` we really need six- to eight-years leases , '' he asserts .",
            "At the same time , he understands why such leases are n't offered .",
            "The land , for the most part , is not owned by large companies but by families with long ties to the area .",
            "The land is so valuable that they just can not tie it up in long-term leases , he admits .",
            "At the same time , that value is a certain guarantee against encroaching development .",
            "`` Last time farmland was for sale here , '' Jones reports somewhat incredulously , `` it went for $ 30,000 an acre . ''",
            "Jones ' advocacy of organic methods is both philosophical and practical .",
            "So-called trap crops _ flowers , alfalfa _ planted alongside cash crops attract beneficial insects and simultaneously take care of such nasty critters as the lygus bug , a small insect that winters in the hills and comes down to the valley in spring .",
            "The lygus injects a poisonous substance into the seeds on the skin of strawberries , causing the seeds to die and making for misshapen berries .",
            "However , given a flavor choice of strawberry or alfalfa , the lygus will go for alfalfa every time , leaving the berries unmolested and proving that organic methods not only make good sense on ecological grounds but are also cost-effective , Jones says .",
            "What 's more , organically grown berries always win in taste tests , report employees of Driscoll Strawberry Associates , the large shipper that contracts with Jones and many other growers .",
            "( Jones also gets his patented plants from Driscoll 's nurseries . )",
            "While organic growing methods are still in their infancy nationwide and account for a relatively small percentage of fruit grown in the Salinas Valley , the idea is catching on .",
            "For growers like Jones , the popularity of organic produce means higher prices , which in turn means that field workers receive a better wage _ typically $ 9.80 an hour rather than the $ 9.35 working in conventionally cultivated fields _ guaranteeing their commitment to these environment-friendly methods .",
            "`` Our people ( workers ) are the real key to our success , '' says Jones , adding proudly that his company experiences a 95 percent return rate among the roughly 150 workers employed during the May-November harvest season .",
            "During that time , 16-hour work days are common .",
            "Jones admits ruefully that at times he 's so bushed that he forgets to bring home berries for his wife and three children for days on end .",

            "The scent is probably why marigolds , which make fine cut flowers , do not get used in floral arrangements more often .",

            "Experiments at the U.S .",
            "Agricultural Research Service Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce , Fla. , have demonstrated that sheets of clear plastic laid over the soil trap enough solar heat to kill most of the harmful organisms .",
            "For years farmers have used methyl bromide to destroy weed seed , plant diseases and nematodes , the microscopic worms responsible for billions of dollars in crops losses , in the soil .",

            "As a result , the Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will ban its use in 2005 .",
            "Daniel O. Chellemi , an ARS plant pathologist at the Ft. Pierce laboratory , has shown that the plastic traps heat in the soil in a greenhouse effect .",
            "Employed for at least six weeks during the summer , the system can kill off weed seeds and diseases that would otherwise wreck a winter crop , Chellemi said .",
            "The system has its limitations .",
            "For example , it can not be used for spring crops because the plastic must lie on the soil for at least six weeks prior to planting , and in the winter before spring crops are planted there is insufficient heat for the system to work .",
            "In 1998 , Chellemi applied the treatment to four commercial farms in Florida .",
            "On three of the farms , yields on solarized fields ranged from 96 to 123 percent of those from methyl bromide-treated fields .",
            "A comparison was not possible on the fourth farm , operated by Vero Beach organic grower Kevin O'Dare , because O'Dare does not use methyl bromide or any other chemicals .",
            "`` I ca n't say enough for it , '' O'Dare says of the plastic treatment , which Chellemi calls `` solarization . ''",
            "The weed purple nutsedge was close to taking over the 10 acres of O'Dare 's Osceola Organic Farm when he turned to solarization .",
            "After two years , he said , `` our production was up 30 percent , our labor was down 75 percent , and our profits were up 100 percent . ''",
            "The solar sheets are not a perfect replacement for methyl bromide , notes University of Florida horticulture professor Steve Olson , who has collaborated with Chellemi .",
            "For example , it is not particularly effective against the nematode that causes `` root knot , '' he said .",
