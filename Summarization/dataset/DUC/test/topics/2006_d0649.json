            "Yet they did not become really close until the late 1980s .",
            "They say it was Rector Merkuryev of Leningrad University who recommended Putin to Sobchak as a highly efficient person .",
            "Over the 10 subsequent years Putin lived up to that recommendation : He followed Sobchak like a shadow to official receptions as well as to more artistic functions such as concerts by the pop star Alla Pugacheva , who was greatly admired by the Sobchaks , even though Putin himself preferred the Mariinsky Opera House .",
            "Soon no decision at the city hall was made without Putin 's knowledge .",
            "Sobchak , who rarely trusted anyone and who often changed his opinion about the people around him , seemed to trust Putin absolutely , saying he was the man one could depend on in a crisis .",
            "In October 1993 , during a rebellion by the deputies after President Yeltsin had dissolved the parliament , a contingent of combat tanks stormed the building .",
            "In that atmosphere of chaos , Putin prudently met the mayor at the airport with a reinforced security detail .",
            "Prior to the 1996 presidential election , Putin led , on Sobchak 's orders , the St. Petersburg NDR ( `` Our Home Is Russia '' ) office .",
            "In the summer of 1996 Putin ran Sobchak 's election campaign and also sued Alexander Belyayev , who was then the chairman of the Legislative Assembly .",
            "At the height of a gubernatorial election campaign , he alleged that Sobchak and Putin owned real estate abroad and kept large amounts of money in foreign banks .",
            "Belyayev had to apologize and soon disappeared from the St. Petersburg political scene .",
            "After Sobchak 's defeat in the gubernatorial election , Putin flatly refused to work with the new team , saying that `` it would look like an act of treachery . ''",
            "Sobchak 's recent triumphant return from self-imposed exile in Paris was largely attributed to Putin 's increased clout .",
            "Incidentally , only a short while ago it was rumored in St. Petersburg that Putin might become the next governor .",
            "Yet , responding to my question about the likelihood , Sobchak said that Putin 's potential was much bigger than that .",
            "One of Putin 's former colleagues at Smolny recalls that he always acted in an admirably manly style : `` If he was friends with someone , that was great luck , but those he was down on were in real trouble . ''",
            "Curiously , when moving into a new office , Putin never initiated any redecoration jobs , which never failed to stun some of the bureaucrats .",
            "Thus in St. Petersburg , when he first entered Putin 's office , Sergei Tkachev , the office 's former occupant just appointed chairman of the Smolny External Relations Committee , could not hold back his astonishment : `` Why did n't he have the furniture changed at least ? ''",
            "Putin liked meeting with his friends at a suburban dacha which , incidentally , burned down as soon as he moved to Moscow and has not been rebuilt .",
            "His wife with two daughters immediately followed her husband to Moscow .",
            "Putin 's parents are dead .",
            "Now , in St. Petersburg , Putin has just a handful of friends , and also his wife 's relatives .",
            "And of course , the Neva River , the Mariinsky Opera House and Vasilyevsky Island too .",
            "If Putin is a hero to anyone it is to the military .",
            "By his edict , the defense budget will now have more money for guns and less for nuclear bombs .",
            "At a government cabinet session on Jan. 27 , Putin said defense spending this year will be 50 percent higher than last year .",
            "A bigger defense budget , he stressed , was a `` conscious choice , '' not related to the recent events in the North Caucasus .",
            "`` The problem here runs deeper and it has to do with the fact that the military has been underfunded for many years in a row , which has led to negative consequences for the country 's defense capability , '' Putin summed up .",
            "He is the first Russian leader in recent years to state bluntly that Russia intends to put more money into weapons production and its armed forces .",
            "Judging by Putin 's habit to carefully select the venue and timing for such statements , his address at the cabinet session was a well-calculated move that clearly had a specific target audience _ above all , the Russian armed forces , who remain desperate for support , and the outside world , which is concerned more about the security of Russian nuclear stockpiles than about tanks .",
            "For the first time in many years , the defense production and arms-procurement program has been approved in January .",
            "Previously , neither the Defense Ministry , which places production orders , nor the defense production enterprises knew what to produce , or in what volumes , until summer .",
            "In recent years , 80 percent of all funds was spent on the Strategic Nuclear Forces , with conventional weapons programs _ given the chronic underfunding of the defense sector _ getting just a pittance .",
            "This year , according to Ilya Klebanov , vice premier in charge of the military-industrial complex , 30 percent of the defense budget will be spent on the nuclear forces while the remaining 70 percent , on conventional weapons systems .",
            "Considerable sums will be spent on R & AMP ; D projects .",
            "Although Putin denies the new defense budget is linked to the war in Chechnya , there is a link .",
            "The war has apparently affected the military 's kitty .",
            "After the outbreak of the second military campaign in Chechnya , the state disbursed , as a matter of urgency , an extra 4 billion rubles for arms procurement programs and immediately raised the question of increasing the share of defense spending in the 2000 budget .",
            "True , the government has yet to find the money _ not just on paper .",
            "Before the operation in Chechnya began , the defense sector received only 46 percent of the earmarked funding , whereas by the end of last year this figure had grown to 86 percent , which is an all-time record in recent years .",
            "Even so , Putin remains a unique candidate on the scene .",
            "For the first time since the 1917 Revolution , the next head of state in Russia could be a person born in a capital city _ in Putin 's case , in Leningrad on Oct. 7 , 1952 .",
