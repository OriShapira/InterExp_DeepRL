            "WASHINGTON _ The United States believed that senior Iraqi scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed last week , administration and intelligence officials said on Monday .",
            "The evidence the administration has cited as justification for the attack consisted of a soil sample secretly obtained months ago outside the pharmaceutical factory , the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries , the officials said .",
            "Officially the administration has refused to describe its evidence in any detail , or to say how it was obtained .",
            "The sample contained a rare chemical that would require two more complex steps to be turned into VX , one of the deadliest nerve agents in existence , and the chemical , whose acronym is EMPTA , has no industrial uses .",
            "The United Nations and the United States have long agreed that Iraq is extremely skilled at many kinds of VX production , having worked for years to perfect the best process .",
            "The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , also said there was evidence that senior Iraqi scientists had aided the efforts to make VX at that factory , and at another plant a couple of miles away .",
            "The connection with Iraq emerged as a key part of the administration 's argument for why it was justified in launching cruise missiles at a plant in another country without any warning .",
            "The officials disclosed the information , four days after the American strike , to try to counter claims by the Sudanese government that the factory , located in an industrial area of Khartoum , was purely a benign commercial venture that produced half of the Sudan 's medicines .",
            "The United States , however , rebuffed calls from the Sudan and other countries to turn over its evidence .",
            "At the United Nations , the Security Council on Monday put off a request by Arab nations _ submitted by one of the United States ' closest Arab allies , Kuwait _ to send inspectors to search the rubble in Khartoum for signs of chemicals related to VX .",
            "`` I do n't see what the purpose of a fact-finding study would be , '' Peter Burleigh , the deputy American representative to the United Nations , said after the meeting .",
            "`` We have credible information that fully justifies the strike we made on that one facility in Khartoum . ''",
            "At a news conference in Khartoum , the Sudanese president , Omar Hassan el-Bashir , kept up his sharp attacks on the United States and President Clinton , saying Clinton ordered the attack to cover up the furor over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky .",
            "Clinton and his senior aides have described the evidence linking the factory to the production of VX as compelling and even irrefutable , though until Monday the administration refused to discuss the evidence in any but the most general way .",
            "The officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the soil sample , collected outside the factory , contained traces of a `` precursor chemical `` called ethyl methylphosphonothionate , or EMPTA .",
            "There would be no viable explanation for the presence of that chemical , they said , other than the production of VX .",
            "`` You do n't obtain this chemical because you 're making ball point pens or whatever , '' an administration official said .",
            "`` If you 're making this , you 're making VX . ''",
            "VX is an odorless , colorless liquid that can kill with remarkable speed .",
            "A mere drop on the skin or inhaled in the lungs is enough to kill an adult within minutes .",
            "There are a number of ways to make the agent , but the officials in Washington and other American and foreign officials said the technique using EMPTA is one Iraq used to develop its own VX stockpiles in the 1980s .",
            "Officials in Washington and at the United Nations said there were a number of other factors linking Iraq to the pharmaceutical plant , as well as a second facility .",
            "Earlier this year , President Saddam Hussein 's government asked the committee that monitors U.N. sanctions to allow it to buy medicines from the factory under the `` oil for food '' program that allows humanitarian supplies into Iraq .",
            "Antonio Monteiro , Portugal 's representative to the United Nations who is this month 's president of the sanctions committee , confirmed the request , but the officials said it was not clear what medicines were ordered or whether any were ever delivered .",
            "Although the United Nations closely monitors goods purchased under the `` oil for food '' program , the officials said the contract could have provided a pretext for extensive visits by Iraqi officials .",
            "A senior intelligence official said that one of the leaders of Iraq 's chemical weapons program , Emad al-Ani , had close ties with senior Sudanese officials at the factory .",
            "The official said a number of Iraqi scientists working for Emad al-Ani had attended the grand opening of the factory two years ago .",
            "Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant , officials in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected of making chemical weapons .",
            "That site , according to diplomats in New York and the Sudan , has been frequently visited by Iraqi technicians and was more heavily guarded than Shifa Pharmaceutical .",
            "However , it also in a residential neighborhood , and officials familiar with planning for the American cruise missile strikes said the fear of collateral damage was a factor in choosing a target .",
            "A strike at a plant that made VX itself , not merely a precursor to it , would pose significant risks of scattering a deadly nerve agent during an attack ."

            "WASHINGTON _ The chemical that the United States cited to justify its bombing of a Sudanese factory last week could be used for commercial products , the agency overseeing the treaty barring chemical weapons said on Wednesday .",
            "The United States has insisted that the chemical found outside the plant could only mean that the plant was intended to make the nerve agent VX .",
            "Sudan contends the plant made medicines and veterinary products .",
            "The international treaty group , the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , conceded that it was not aware of any commercial product on the market that contained the chemical , nor of another chemical compound made with it .",
            "But its spokesman , Donato Kinigier-Passigli , said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that a search of scientific papers showed the chemical , known as EMPTA , could be used `` in limited quantities for legitimate commercial purposes . ''",
            "The uses , he said , included fungicides and anti-microbial agents , and not just the production of VX .",
            "One Pentagon official said that the treaty organization had simply uncovered academic examples of possible use with no real evidence that any commercial products are made from EMPTA .",
            "`` Just because you identify a chemical agent for commercial uses , that does not mean anyone makes it , '' the official said .",
            "In the chemical industry , experts said they were not aware of any commercial uses for EMPTA , nor could they foresee any practical uses based on what is known about the chemical .",
            "Aldrich Chemical Co. in Milwaukee makes the chemical and sells it at $ 45 a gram to laboratories for research .",
            "But a spokesman said the company was not aware of its use in any commercial products .",
            "The Clinton administration leveled the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. plant in Khartoum with a volley of cruise missiles last Thursday , saying it had evidence linking the factory to the manufacturing of VX and to a shadowy network of terrorists .",
            "Facing questions about the decision to bomb the factory , senior administration officials said on Monday that a soil sample collected nearby provided irrefutable evidence of the presence of VX at the plant .",
            "Kinigier-Passigli emphasized that the organization had come to no conclusions about the administration 's charges or the Sudan 's counter-charges .",
            "The independent organization administers the chemical weapons treaty , signed by more than 160 nations and ratified by the U.S. Senate last year .",
            "Still , the organization 's disclosure raised questions about the administration 's categorical assertions that there could be no other possible explanation for the presence of EMPTA , or ethyl methylphosphonothionate .",
            "Wednesday 's disclosure added to a number of inconsistencies in the administration 's accusations , including statements by a senior intelligence official hours after the bombing that the plant in Khartoum was heavily guarded and produced no commercial products .",
            "Administration officials declined on Wednesday to discuss the evidence or the caveats raised by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons .",
            "However , Defense and intelligence officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said they still believed there could be no other explanation for the presence of EMPTA in a soil sample secretly collected outside the facility several months ago .",
            "On Wednesday , several American experts in chemical warfare and analysis offered another possible explanation .",
            "They said the chemical 's structure resembled that of an agricultural insecticide , known as FONOFOS , which is commercially available in Africa .",
            "While the two are not identical , they have molecular similarities and could be confused in a laboratory test performed under less-than-ideal conditions , said Hank Ellison , a counterterrorism expert who ran the Army 's chemical and biological warfare programs at Fort Campbell , Ky. , in the 1980s .",
            "Ellison , now the president of Cerberus & AMP ; Associates , Inc. , a security consulting firm in Michigan , said that while the chemical characteristics of FONOFOS and EMPTA were not identical , they were `` very similar '' and those similarities `` could be misinterpreted in a lab analysis . ''",
            "`` I imagine this soil sample was n't taken under the best of circumstances , by somebody placing it in a cooler and immediately sending it to a lab , '' he said .",
            "`` And quality control for the storage and manufacture of pesticides and insecticides is not the highest in the world , so that could increase the possibility of seeing similarities in the chemical structure . ''",
            "The defense and intelligence officials dismissed the possibility that the United States could have misinterpreted the soil sample .",
            "In the Hague , an official with the chemical weapons organization , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said scientific research also suggested that EMPTA could be the byproduct of the breakdown of other pesticides .",
            "The international treaty , which the United States Senate ratified last year despite the reservations of many conservative Republicans , who said the organization would never be effective , does not identify EMPTA by name .",
            "But the treaty covers it under the `` Schedule 2 '' list of chemicals that are subject to scrutiny by the organization 's inspectors .",
            "By definition , chemicals included on Schedule 2 can have legitimate commercial purposes .",
            "That is unlike chemicals on Schedule 1 , which are deemed to have no other use than to kill people and are strictly prohibited .",
            "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is the international agency whose more than 400 enginers and diplomats oversee the inspections of governments and chemical companies around the world to assure they are not making prohibited agents .",
            "The group searched known scientific literature in respone to press inquiries on EMPTA .",
            "The Sudan has not signed the treaty , so factories like Shifa Pharmaceuticals are not subject to its inspectors , unlike companies in the United States and other nations that have approved the accord .",
            "While the organization did not identify any products using EMPTA , officials said they could not rule out the possibility as strongly as the administration has .",
            "The official at the organization , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the scientific research showed companies including the Mobil Corp. and International Chemical Industries of America had conducted research into commercial applications that used EMPTA .",

            "Tsuchihashi said no research had been published in the scientific literature about the metabolism of VX and its breakdown products , so the discovery of EMPTA in the man 's blood could lead to a diagnostic test to determine if the agent was used used in any future attacks .",

Tucker , a chemical weapons expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies .",
            "In 1986 and 1987 before the breakup of the country , according to a newsletter by Applied Science and Analysis , a respected trade publication , the former Yugoslavia produced 250 sarin filled artillery shells , which were put into storage .",
            "In addition , it had an ambitious program for 1990-1995 for producing 3,000 rockets filled with the sarin nerve agent and 100 artillery shells filled with mustard gas .",
            "The plan also called for 100 short-range missiles with mustard gas warheads .",
            "The plan was interrupted by the breakup of the country , and while at least some chemical weapons were destroyed , it is unclear how many remain , the newsletter asserts .",
            "Moreover , the newsletter reports , the fate of some 30 tons of CH3POCl2 , a chemical that is restricted by a treaty banning chemical weapons because it can be used to make sarin and other chemical agents , is unknown .",
            "The material was taken from a chemical agent production facility in Mostar in Bosnia in early 1992 .",
            "`` Much of former Yugoslavia 's former chemical weapons infrastructure , production capacity and expertise is now in Serbian hands , '' Tucker said .",
            "In other words , while the size of the current chemical weapons stockpile is unknown , he added , Yugoslavia appears to retain the ability to produce such agents quickly .",
            "Yugoslavia has not signed the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention , which bans development , production , stockpiling , transfer and use of chemical weapons .",
            "The convention also bans the use of nonlethal riot control agents like CS `` as a method of warfare . ''",
            "Developed by the British in the 1950s , CS is a military code-name for ortho-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile , which causes intense irritation of the eyes with crying or temporary blindness and irritation of the respiratory system and stomach .",
            "The United States , which has signed and ratified the convention , has unilaterally reserved the right to use CS in narrowly defined defensive situations like rescuing downed pilots behind enemy lines .",
            "During the Vietnam War , it was used extensively , and CS is still widely used for domestic-riot control , which is permitted under the Chemical Weapons Convention .",
            "By contrast , the nerve agent BZ , whose chemical name is 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate , is totally banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention .",

            "In a second report issued a year later , Human Rights Watch said there was significant circumstantial evidence based on survivor testimony that Bosnian Serb forces commanded by Gen. Ratko Mladic had used BZ against Bosnian Muslims fleeing the town of Srebrenica in July 1995 .",
            "In November 1998 , the State Department said while it believed the Serbs had used tear gas against Muslims during the Bosnian war , it had no evidence that BZ or other chemical weapons were used during the siege of Srebrenica .",
            "The Defense Department has been closely monitoring Yugoslavia 's chemical facilities for months , officials said .",
            "A report in January 1998 by the Pentagon 's Defense Intelligence Agency , one expert said , assessed the development and deployment of chemical agents in both Serbia and Croatia and examined the Yugoslav army 's doctrines regarding their use .",
            "It also studied the potential impact any direct military attacks on chemical stockpiles would have on civilians and the surroundings .",
            "The Yugoslav army is well prepared to defend itself against chemical attacks , Pentagon officials said .",
