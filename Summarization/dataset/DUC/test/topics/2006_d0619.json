            "`` The homosexual agenda is incompatible with family life , '' the groups , including the Southern Baptist Convention , told Bush in a letter saying he should meet with them to `` demonstrate your commitment to the family by ... meeting with those of us who believe that homosexual activism poses a serious threat to our marriage-based culture and to the freedoms of speech , religion and association .

            "Leaders of the nation 's largest gay political organization said the GOP national convention demonstrated `` meanness '' toward gays and that the election of presidential nominee George W. Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney would be a setback for gay rights .",
            "`` The verdict is in , '' Winnie Stachelberg , political director for the Human Rights Campaign , said as Bush prepared to deliver his acceptance speech .",

            "It is clear that the kinder , gentler face we see at the convention is nothing more than a facade . ''",
            "Elizabeth Birch , the group 's executive director , said that the four-day affair was disappointing , even though the GOP sought to soften hard-line opposition to homosexual rights by allowing Rep. Jim Kolbe , R-Ariz. , to address delegates .",
            "Kolbe is openly gay .",
            "The gay rights officials spoke at a news conference in Washington , D.C .",

            "The platform defines marriage `` as the legal union of one man and one woman . ''",
            "It says that `` federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages . ''",
            "And the platform further says that homosexuals should be exempt from anti-discrimination laws and that homosexuality is incompatible with military service .",
            "Stachelberg said a low point for gays at the Republican convention was on Tuesday as Kolbe spoke to delegates in a four-minute speech on international trade .",

            "`` The presence of Mary Cheney as an openly lesbian person shines a light on the fact that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have positions of grave concern to gay and lesbian people in this country , '' Birch said .",
            "But Kevin Ivers , a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans , the country 's largest organization for gay Republicans , said despite the Kolbe incident and the platform , the convention was by far the most successful ever for homosexual Republicans .",

            "''We 've seen real advances this week , `` he said , pointing to a platform committee that had initially removed the anti-gay language , only to be overruled by conservatives .",
            "The fact that Kolbe was asked to speak by Bush was a significant attempt at reaching out to gay Republicans , he said , adding that most of the 2,066 convention delegates applauded Kolbe heartily .",
            "One other indication that the party is warming to gays : there were more openly gay convention delegates ( 19 ) to this GOP convention than at any previous .",
            "There were five gay delegates in 1996 and two alternates in 1992 , Ivers said .",
            "`` This week was a success .",
            "We are at a turning point ( in the Republican Party ) on gay and lesbian issues , '' Ivers said .",

            "But in April , he met with gay Republicans saying afterwards that he was `` a better man '' for it .",
            "Republicans also note that Cheney , while secretary of defense in 1991 , supported his spokesman , Pete Williams , when he announced he was gay .",
            "`` I have operated on the basis , over the years , with respect to my personal staff that I do n't ask them about their private lives .",

            "McCain spokesman Dan Schnur told `` The Arizona Republic '' that the senator `` has indicated that he disagrees with the decision '' by the Vermont court .",
            "McCain also backs the `` Do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy on gays in the military , putting him at odds with Steve May , a prominent Log Cabin Republican supporter in Phoenix who is threatened with an Army discharge because of his sexual orientation .",
            "Yet on Dec. 14 , McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , simultaneously addressed members of the Log Cabin Republicans by satellite television at fund-raisers in Boston , Chicago , Minneapolis , New Orleans , New York , Seattle and Washington , D.C. , and raised about $ 40,000 for the campaign .",

            "In 1996 , McCain helped ensure the defeat of a bill , which lost on a 50-49 vote , that would have barred employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .",

Bush , who has thus far declined the group 's invitation , McCain sat down with members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he would work to end discrimination , and that appears to be enough for many gay Republicans , particularly when the senator 's position is compared with those of other presidential candidates .",
