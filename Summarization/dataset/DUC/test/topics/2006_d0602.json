            "Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports , working to achieve a fashionable lean-but-muscular look or suffering from a deep psychological disorder , teen-age girls are using illegal anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers , health authorities say .",
            "The increased usage among girls , which some researchers attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia , has caught up to levels that began to be established by boys in the 1980s .",
            "And steroid use , researchers say , exposes girls to the same severe health risks , but with the added potential of destroying their ability to bear children .",
            "The National Institutes of Drug Abuse says about 175,000 teen-age girls in the United States have reported taking anabolic steroids at least once within a year of the time surveyed _ a rise of 100 percent since 1991 .",
            "The surveys , by the University of Michigan 's Institute for Social Research , the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the Youth Risk and Behavior Survey System , were done in schools or the home through anonymous self-reported questionnaires .",
            "Dr. Lloyd D. Johnston , director of the Michigan project , which has been conducting annual youth surveys since 1975 , said the actual number of users may actually be higher than the most recent surveys show , since people tend to underreport drug use .",
            "The rate among teen-age boys has also continued to rise , to the current estimated level of 325,000 .",
            "Other indications , including the results of a small study in Oregon , are that steroid use among both girls and boys is increasing unabated .",
            "The three national surveys were conducted before Mark McGwire set baseball 's single-season home run record last year , acknowledging that he used androstenedione , a precursor of testosterone , to help him build muscle .",
            "Whether androstenedione , which is allowed in professional baseball but banned in other sports , does in fact build muscles remains a matter of medical dispute , though the perception of many athletes , both adult and adolescent , is that it does .",
            "In any case , sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids .",
            "`` I get calls every day from the coaches and parents of girls as well as boys , '' said Dr. Linn Goldberg , a physician at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and a United States Olympic Committee drug testing official .",
            "`` Some are concerned and some want to know whether their children should use androstenedione . ''",
            "His answer is an unequivocal no , either to use of steroids or androstenedione .",
            "Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone , the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass , facial hair and a deep voice .",
            "The hormone exists in females as well , though in much smaller amounts .",
            "Liver cancer , heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages .",
            "The health damages might not appear for years or decades after the steroids are taken , said Dr. Gary I. Wadler , a professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine .",
            "Dr. Charles E. Yesalis , a steroid authority at Pennsylvania State University , was among the first to analyze the 1997 female-adolescent data in December of that year in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and to sound the alarm .",
            "Most prevention programs , he said recently , have not been effective .",
            "`` I am asked to speak in schools and other institutions , '' Yesalis said , `` but you do n't get anywhere with speeches or charts or film clips or posters .",
            "We know one-shot messages do n't work . ''",
            "Goldberg said teen-age boys and girls generally obtain illegal steroids from people who congregate at commercial gyms .",
            "`` That 's where most people say they obtain them , '' Goldberg said .",
            "`` Someone , in this part of the country , will go down to Mexico , where it is easy to get the stuff , and bring it back , either in pill form or injectables . ''",
            "And then one young person will buy some and distribute them to his or her schoolmates , he said .",
            "The new interest among teen-age girls , these and other health experts say , reflect a gradual change in attitude , and fashion , or teen-age peer pressure , away from a preoccupation with thinness .",
            "Some teen-age girls now desire to look more healthy and somewhat more muscular , but this has led some girls toward an unhealthy compulsion to be ever fitter with larger muscles .",
            "`` We 've gone from the overweight beauty of the Rubens women , to the thin rail of the Twiggy types and now back to something in between , the lean but muscular type , '' Wadler said .",
            "`` These are people who are virtually addicted to the mirror .",
            "But they will never be satisfied with what they see , and this is now happening to teen-age girls who want bigger muscles no matter how much bigger their muscles have become . ''",
            "Dr. Harrison G. Pope Jr. , chief of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory of Harvard Medical School 's McLean Hospital , and colleagues referred to a similar disorder in male weight lifters as `` reverse anorexia '' after it was observed in 1993 .",
            "The researchers recently updated the work with a study of 32 women bodybuilders , 17 of whom showed signs of an emotional disorder called body dysmorphism , which is the excessive preoccupation with a trait or traits of the body viewed as ugly or defective whether they are or not .",
            "Several women in the study were so addicted to working out that they cut off job opportunities and close personal relationships .",
            "But Pope said too little research had been done on this emerging obsession among teen-age girls to draw specific conclusions about its complex causes .",
            "( STORY CAN END HERE .",
            "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn The case of one of the worst known adverse reactions to steroid use , reported by Goldberg , is that of a 19-year-old West Coast woman who was preparing to enter her first bodybuilding contest , lifting weights and eating a high-protein diet .",
            "She then switched to a drastically reduced intake of food and water .",
            "Obsessed with her goal , she began taking anabolic steroids and a diuretic .",
            "The steroid would add muscle and the diuretic would drain the body of fluid and make the muscle stand out more .",
            "She won the contest , but it will probably be her last .",
            "After she collected her trophy , she resumed drinking water and eating normally , and her weight shot up by 25 pounds in three days .",
            "It turned out that the diuretic had masked the actual amount of muscle she had built up , said Goldberg , who was one of a group of health experts who reviewed the case .",
            "When she drank more fluids , he said , her muscles pushed out to the full over-developed size and crushed blood vessels in her legs .",
            "Called compartment syndrome , the condition put her limbs , if not her life , in danger , and surgeons had to cut open both legs to protect her vascular system and remove significant amounts of the new muscle tissue .",
            "Goldberg and Dr. Diane L. Elliot hope to educate girls about the dangers of steroid use as they have done with boys .",
            "They recently completed a program , called Atlas , that is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and is aimed at reducing steroid use among young male athletes .",
            "A main element of the program , involving 3,200 male athletes at 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington , was to teach the students to educate one another on the problems .",
            "The number of male students that reported having used steroids within a year was cut by 50 percent .",
            "Under another National Institute of Drug Abuse grant , they are developing a similar program for girls .",
            "Yesalis said the Goldberg-Elliot program was the only one he knew of that worked .",
            "`` Unless young people are taught to know where and how to draw the line , to know that it 's not right to try to win at all costs , they 're not going to listen when you tell them steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning , '' he said ."

            "An over-the-counter supplement called `` andro , '' made popular when baseball slugger Mark McGwire admitted using it in 1998 , raises testosterone and estrogen above normal levels and could be dangerous , according to a Harvard study financed by Major League Baseball and its players union .",
            "However , hormone levels receded after its use was stopped .",
            "The study , published in Wednesday 's Journal of the American Medical Association , is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels .",
            "However , the trial lasted just one week , and did not measure whether the dietary supplement can do what its producers say it can : increase muscle size and mass .",
            "Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement has long-term side effects .",
            "Androstenedione is naturally produced in both men and women , and converts to either testosterone or to an estrogen .",
            "Testosterone is the body 's major muscle builder .",
            "The pill , legal and sold over-the-counter , is banned by the International Olympic Committee , the National Football League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association .",
            "Major League Baseball , the National Basketball Association , and the National Hockey League has no restriction regarding its use .",
            "Little is known about andro , which became available in the United States several years ago even though it was developed in the 1970s by the East Germans to enhance their athletes ' Olympic performance .",
            "Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder , an endocrinologist at the Harvard-affliated Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , who led the study , said men showed increased testosterone levels when andro was taken for seven days in a single daily 300 milligram dose .",
            "On the Internet , pills available are in doses of 50 to 300 milligrams .",
            "The 42 subjects , ages 20 to 40 , were divided into three groups and received either no androstenedione , 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily .",
            "In the 300 mg group , testosterone levels in the blood increased by an average of 34 percent by the seventh day , though levels had returned to normal by the following day .",
            "Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels , Leder noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects .",
            "Side effects include stunted growth for young people , increased aggressiveness , and lower levels of `` good '' cholesterol , which could increase risk of heart disease .",
            "Men with elevated estrogen levels sometimes grow breasts and suffer shrunken testicles , while women with elevated testosterone can develop masculine traits , such as deepening of voice and extra hair .",
            "In a eight-week study by Douglas King at Iowa State University published in JAMA last June , King found that andro caused none of the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced strength .",
            "However , the 300 mg dosages were given in 100 mg increments three times a day .",
            "Leder said that their study also found that 100 milligrams is too small a dose to increase testosterone levels .",
            "`` I certainly would n't recommend anyone to take it , '' said King , associate professor of health and human performance at Iowa State .",
            "And King warned that because the testosterone levels do not stay elevated for very long , people may take it several times a day to keep levels elevated , which could be dangerous .",
            "For now , Major League Baseball does not plan to change its policy .",
            "`` That androstenedione , when taken in higher than suggested doses , elevates testosterone levels , appears to be a significant contribution to the science surrounding its use , '' said Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig .",
            "But he and Don Fehr , director of the players union , said that more research is needed .",
            "Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals has said that he has since stopped using the supplement .",
            "While some of the professional sports leagues are still waiting for more data , their team doctors have come out against the supplement .",
            "The Association of Professional Team Physicians , an organization comprised of team physicians of the NBA , NHL , MLB , and NFL said in 1998 that it recommended androstenedione be taken off the consumer market , reclassified as a controlled substance available only by prescription , and it urged the drug be banned from competitive sports .",
            "`` The study fortifies our position , '' said Dr. William Straw , who is the team physician for the San Jose Sharks , a National Hockey League team , and was the team physician for baseball 's San Francisco Giants for 13 years .",
            "`` From a medical point of view , the study justifies physicians ' concern that andro is potentially harmful , like any other anabolic steroid , '' said Straw .",
            "`` By its chemical composition , it is an anabolic steroid . ''",
            "Straw criticized drug deregulation laws in 1994 for allowing such easy access to supplements like andro .",
            "`` These things are out of control , '' said Straw .",
            "John Brennan , spokesman of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , said the federal government is studying if androstenedione `` fits all the elements of a steroid , which is a banned substance . ''",
            "If andro does , then it would probably be reclassified so that it could not be taken without a doctor 's prescription , said Brennan ."

            "Experts who study the effects of synthetic anabolic steroids are encouraged , for two distinctly different reasons , that two new trials of their use show a benefit for two groups of very sick people .",
            "One reason is the possible long-term benefits for the patients .",
            "But the other is that the trials may serve as a reminder of whom the drugs were not intended for : healthy people who use them in ways that can destroy their health .",
            "The trials , reported last week , found that taking anabolic steroids helped kidney dialysis patients and people with HIV regain some of the weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result of their illnesses .",
            "Dr. Gary Wadler , an anabolic-steroid authority at New York University Medical Center , points out that the first widespread use of the drug came after World War II for people who were wasting away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in concentration camps .",
            "It was for these people , the very sick , that steroids were developed , he said , not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance .",
            "The latter include baseball 's new home-run king , Mark McGwire , who says he regularly takes androstenedione , a precursor steroid that quickly becomes anabolic once taken into the body .",
            "Professional baseball , unlike other sports , has not banned this substance .",
            "Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences , with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage .",
            "These steroids are synthesized from human testosterone , the hormone responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle tissue , facial hair and a deep voice .",
            "Testosterone 's effect as a muscle builder was discovered more than 100 years ago by the French physician Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard , who in 1889 injected animal extracts into a dog and then into himself .",
            "At the time , he hypothesized that added testosterone would be good for human health .",
            "`` Brown-Sequard overinterpreted what was happening , but he turned out to be onto something , as history has shown , '' Wadler said .",
            "The synthetic forms of testosterone were designed to replace the body 's normal supply of the hormone , which can be depleted by disease , and to help the patient regain strength , Wadler said in `` Drugs and the Athlete '' ( Oxford Press ) , regarded as the definitive textbook on the subject .",
            "Dr. Peter Goldberg , a consulting physician for the U.S. Olympic Committee , expressed similar concern about the expanding use of steroids , especially among teen-agers .",
            "Adolescent females are now the fastest growing group of users .",
            "With a colleague , Dr. Diane Elliot , Goldberg recently completed a program for 3,200 athletes in 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington among whom steroid use was reduced by a reported 50 percent .",
            "In the clinical trials of anabolic steroids for kidney-dialysis and HIV patients , low doses were used to reverse previously uncontrollable weight loss , which has been associated with sharply reduced life spans among these groups .",
            "The patients , in the two separate studies reported last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association , were given the steroids in conjunction with exercise programs .",
            "Both groups of patients increased muscle mass significantly more than a group given a placebo , and increased their abilities to do more exercise faster while becoming less fatigued .",
            "More studies are needed to determine how much and for how long steroids can be safely used , the doctors who directed the studies said .",
            "But they pointed out that the doses used by the athletes were much higher .",
            "Weighing medical uses against the uses to enhance athletic performance , those who take steroids must ask : What is a safe dose and when does a dose become dangerous ?",
            "The second question is being urgently studied at a number of major institutions .",
            "In the meantime , Wadler said , all science really knows on the subject is this : It has been found safe to increase the amount of testosterone or testosterone substitute to the normal level among sick people whose supply has become depleted .",
            "But at some level above this , the substitutes can have disastrous results .",
            "The list of problems doctors cite is very long : liver tumors , uncontrollably violent behavior , elevated cholesterol , enlarged veins in the liver that cause fatal bleeding , permanent stunting of growth in adolescents , and blood clotting that leads to premature stroke and heart attacks .",
            "The list of less serious but nevertheless undesirable effects is also long and includes large breasts in men and beards in women ."

            "All five defendants denied , however , that they knowingly damaged the health of the athletes , some of whom were as young as 12 when they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills .",

            "One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by the steroids , which she started taking at 13 .",
            "Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices , serious acne and excessive hair growth .",

            "But since German unification , evidence of the systematic use of steroids to enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German government files .",
            "On Tuesday , Suender , 58 , testified that he had no reservations about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors , which was part of his responsibility .",
            "He denied ever giving steroid injections , as prosecutors have charged .",

            "But it also made it a banner year for an issue far more serious and potentially devastating : athletes using performance-enhancing substances to build bigger and stronger bodies .",
            "McGwire 's admission that he used two supplements , creatine and androstenedione or `` andro , '' suddenly put new light on a decades-old battle to stem the use of anabolic steroids and other so-called ergogenic aids in athletic competition .",
            "With McGwire 's admission has come a new set of concerns : ( BBOX ) That more young athletes will attempt to use supplements as a way of improving performance , fitness and recovery from injuries , instead of building body strength naturally .",
            "( BBOX ) That the supplements will be lumped together and considered to be medically sound simply because they are available over the counter or via mail order .",

            "Linking the two and using both without proper medical supervision could prove dangerous .",
            "While McGwire will go down in the history books as the unqualified home run champion for a single season , other athletes who used similar substances last year faced far different repercussions .",
            "Most recently , Petr Korda was forced to forfeit his rankings points and $ 94,529 in prize money from Wimbledon after the International Tennis Federation found he tested positive for an anabolic steroid .",
            "His attempt to defend his 1998 Australian Open title ended over the weekend , but his appearance stirred controversy among his fellow players , who question how Korda could have been allowed to compete .",

            "They fail to realize that you can buy arsenic too , but you would n't want to use it . ''",
            "The issue becomes all the more confusing to the average young athlete because creatine and andro are two entirely different supplements .",

            "It is classified as a dietary supplement that enhances muscle growth and weight gain , and not a drug .",
            "`` Creatine is acceptable , and it does enhance performance , '' Yesalis said .",
            "`` Although , if you could get the proper dose of creatine in the food supply , why would anybody pay for it ?",
            "It will cost you $ 40 to $ 50 a month . ''",
            "Andro , on the other hand , is considered an anabolic steroid because taken as a pill it raises the level of the male hormone testosterone , and users claim it builds muscle mass and helps speed recovery from sports-related injuries .",

            "They go out to their own people and do their own thing on it . ''",
            "Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body building , primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and because so many athletes endorse its use .",
            "At the University of Washington , strength and conditioning coach Rick Huegli said creatine has been dispensed to many athletes under his direct supervision , with little or no apparent ill effects .",

            "Huegli advises athletes to begin a program of better nutrition and training without the use of supplements before trying anything like creatine .",
            "But he says athletes will always be tempted to use supplements because it `` helps them recover better and train longer and harder . ''",
            "In the past , Huegli said the UW would dispense a one-month supply of creatine to any athlete who wanted to use it , but the school has recently discontinued the practice for fear of liability should an athlete develop a medical problem in the future .",

            "That 's up for debate right now , '' he said .",
            "With concern being voiced by doctors such as Juhn , trainers like Olsen are all the more wary of its potential for abuse .",
            "`` There 's no long-term study done on creatine , so you have no information from 10 years out , '' Olsen said .",
            "From the information he has seen , Olsen believes there are several reasons to beware of the supplement : dehydration , possible kidney problems and cost .",
            "He reports some young athletes spend hundreds of dollars on the product with minimal results .",
            "Compared to andro or other steroids , creatine `` is probably the least harmful , but in 10 years you might have some kid who took three or four times the normal dose and find it was overworking the kidneys or something like that , '' Olsen said .",
            "`` If you get a symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road , how do you relate that back to their creatine use ? ''",
            "There have been some benefits , Olsen said , noting some athletes have gained 10 to 15 pounds in weight and muscle mass .",
            "`` But once they get off of it , they lose maybe half that weight , '' he said .",
            "`` It takes so much water to digest that protein . ''",
            "Juhn notes that creatine is found not only in muscles , but in the brain , the heart , the liver and testicles .",

            "According to Pippig , not only was her ratio 9.2 to 1 , but the abnormality was not due to high testosterone but rather to low epitestosterone , perhaps resulting from a number of conditions specific to gender and health issues that she has been battling since her epic run in 1996 .",
