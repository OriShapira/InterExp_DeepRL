            "They maintain a fifth of those losses have been due to the Army Corps building permit policies .",
            "Environmentalists have sought for years to abolish the so-called nationwide Permit 26 , which applies to development , including home construction and road building , and replace it with individual permits as the Army Corps now is going to do .",

            "At the same time , the group argues , the nationwide permitting system has allowed for fast track approval of thousands of projects without environmental damage .",
            "The average time to get an individual permit approved was more than a year , compared with about a month for the streamlined nationwide permit for construction projects , the group estimated .",
