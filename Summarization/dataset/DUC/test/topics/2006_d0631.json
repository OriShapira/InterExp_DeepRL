            "GONESSE , France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost power in two of its four engines as it was taking off , and the flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft 's landing gear , government investigators said Thursday .",
            "The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of its brief flight , the French Bureau of Accident Investigation , or BEA , also said in a statement .",

            "1 decreased again , the plane lurched strongly to the left and crashed , '' the BEA said .",
            "`` In the sound recording , we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No .",

            "`` The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No .",
            "2 lost power to the point that it stopped , and that engine No .",
            "1 temporarily lost power , '' according to the statement .",
            "Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming from the rear of the plane during take-off , but the Concorde was traveling too fast to halt the flight , the BEA said .",
            "A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine , setting off a chain reaction .",

            "The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris .",
            "Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday on television news reports to determine if , for example , the color and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of the fire , investigators said .",

            "He told the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing .",
            "Auffray said the pilots ' loss of control indicates that a ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside .",
            "Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all 113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to a medical institute in Paris for examination .",
            "Most were burned beyond recognition in the inferno , and can only be identified by dental records or DNA tests .",
            "After remains were removed , about 40 forensic experts in white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings , teeth , scraps of clothing _ that might help identify the victims .",

            "Mourners , including high-level officials from the French and German governments , streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in central Paris to pay their respects to the victims .",
            "It is the same church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess Diana here in 1998 .",

            "A similar ceremony took place at Orly Airport , Paris ' other major airport which is served by Air France .",

            "Merchants said they would close shop to honor the dead .",
            "Also Thursday , the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether charges could be brought for `` involuntary homicide and involuntary injury . ''",

            "In the aftermath of Tuesday 's crash of a chartered Air France Concorde outside Paris , killing all 109 people on the airplane and four people on the ground , most members of the elite club that is the Concorde 's clientele had few qualms about flying the jet again .",
            "`` When I heard about the crash , obviously I was horrified , '' said John Demsey , president of Mac Cosmetics , who flies on the Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris Wednesday on his way to the island of Capri .",
            "His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe .",
            "But Demsey said that he was ready to take his flight even after he heard about the crash .",

            "Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde , which costs more than $ 10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket , described as a business tool .",
            "But that is how many of its denizens refer to it .",
            "Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business , while the rest are celebrities , the superrich or vacationers like members of the German tour group who died in Tuesday 's crash .",
            "For business executives , the advantage of the Concorde , which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and , at 1,350 mph , twice as fast , is not just the time saved in the air .",
            "It is also the time saved on the ground .",
            "British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel .",

            "Wall Street executives have been known to pick up the whiff of a deal after bumping into a competitor with a client .",
            "The Concorde 's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in London , hop on the 7 p.m. Concorde and arrive back in New York the same day at 6 p.m. With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in industries like entertainment , finance , telecommunications and energy , many executives are finding that they are having to travel back and forth to Europe on a regular basis .",

            "`` To me it buys back two days . ''",
            "Besides , one of the Concorde 's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare of more than $ 10,000 roundtrip .",
            "Most fly so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the airlines for discounts of as much as 30 percent , or the price of a business-class ticket , which on Air France is $ 7,050 .",

            "To gain a few hours over regular jets , you had to travel on a plane that was swiftly becoming a museum piece of aeronautics .",

            "WASHINGTON _ A plume of fire about to consume a marvel of aviation , a moment of horror frozen forever in a stunning image : To Prof. W. David Lewis , who studies the history of technology , the burning Concorde looked like a zeppelin for the new century .",
            "`` It 's haunting , '' said Lewis , a historian at Auburn University .",
            "`` That long fiery path in the sky , it reminds me , not in detail but in overall symbolic concept , of the Hindenburg . ''",
            "But it is not just that both had a fiery end , the Air France jet as it took off near Paris on Tuesday and the giant German zeppelin as it was being moored in Lakehurst , N.J. , on May 6 , 1937 .",
            "Both supersonic jet and zeppelin , Lewis pointed out , were symbols of national pride .",
            "Each offered luxury service for a wealthy few , and both operated at times of rapid technological change that made their futures uncertain .",
            "And both , it seems , are instructive about the difficulties of predicting technological progress .",
            "It remains to be seen whether the accident last week , which killed 114 people including five on the ground , will kill the supersonic transports the way the Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible , when it crashed killing 35 people on board and one on the ground .",
            "But progress _ including , perhaps , progress in safety _ has bypassed both .",
            "In its day , the Concorde was the ne plus ultra of technology , the edge of the envelope in speed and altitude .",
            "Thirty years later , the envelope has stretched a great deal , but in other directions , notably toward safety , comfort and reliability .",
            "And though the Concorde still flies twice as fast and twice as high , the question is whether it has been left behind .",
            "Predicting technological change is hard , and the airlines and plane builders are not good at it .",
            "When the Concorde was new , Boeing was turning out 747s , the world 's largest plane , as a stopgap until supersonics could become the mainstay of commercial aviation , and Pan Am was talking about carrying passengers to the moon .",
            "The moon is still there but now is unvisited even by astronauts .",
            "Pan Am is gone .",
            "The 747 has only grown to carry more people more miles , and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of an endangered species : 20 were built ; 12 remain .",
            "There are more of every high-profile thing that flies , except maybe for the space shuttles and the Goodyear blimps .",
            "Technology has advanced in ways almost unimaginable in 1976 , when the Concordes entered commercial service to the United States .",
            "And while expectations may have scaled back in some areas , like trips to the moon , they have grown in other ways , almost without our noticing , especially in the ubiquity and safety of air travel .",
            "In 1969 , the year the Concorde first broke the sound barrier , the total number of people carried on planes in the United States was less than the country 's population .",

            "The Concorde is one of the few examples in history of a technology whose successor was slower .",
            "It bears a passing resemblance to the U.S. nuclear power industry , which used a technology that looked advanced and attractive in the 1960s and '70s , only to seem , 20 years later , esoteric and not worth the bother and expense .",
            "It is as if the airlines have decided the tortoise is sexier than the hare .",
            "Flying is now safer than driving , taking the train or walking , and almost safer than staying home .",
            "One reason is that airplanes are now mass produced , and their failures protect each other .",
            "There are , for example , about 2,600 Boeing 737s in service , and every now and then , somebody finds something worrisome in one of them , like a power conduit inside a fuel tank that has short-circuited and is giving off sparks .",
            "But the result is a swift order to inspect the other thousands for the same problem and fix it .",
            "In contrast , if the cause of the Concorde crash turns out to be a generic flaw , the population protected will be the remaining 12 airplanes .",
            "But in the grand sweep of technological progress , that may not be a fair way to consider safety , or even a sensible one .",

            "Some 1,500 mourners attended the hourlong ecumenical service led by the Cologne bishop and the head of the German Lutheran Church .",
            "One theme ran throughout the service -- encapsulated in a question by the Cathedral 's priest , Bernard Henrichs : `` What are the limits of what is possible ? ''",
