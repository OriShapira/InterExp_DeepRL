            "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- President Clinton is forecasting decades of federal budget surpluses , $ 4.854 trillion worth by 2014 -- precise predictions that come with only one certainty .",
            "They will be off the mark .",
            "By how much , and whether the projections are too high or too low , depends on the economy , the decisions of at least two future presidents , and what happens during the next seven Congresses .",
            "Clinton 's 15-year plan forecasts surpluses far exceeding those projected by the administration and Congress 15 months ago .",
            "`` The predictions are that for the next quarter century , whatever the ups and downs of the business cycle , the general trend is going to be for surpluses every year for the next 25 years , '' Clinton said .",
            "There 's no disagreement on the upward trend ; the director of the Congressional Budget Office said that only a cataclysmic recession would undo surpluses .",
            "But translating trends into numbers stretching 10 and 15 years ahead is educated speculation .",
            "The specialists say so .",
            "`` There is no way for anyone projecting the economy to be able to say their projections will come true , because chances are they wo n't , '' said June O'Neill , completing her term as director of the CBO .",
            "Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said it is impossible to `` confidently project large surpluses '' over the next 15 years , given the uncertainties of budget forecasting .",
            "He noted that two years ago , the Office of Management and Budget projected a $ 121 billion deficit in the 1998 budget , which turned out to be `` a $ 191 billion error . ''",
            "The Congressional Budget Office said that its five-year projections were off by an average of 13 percent annually .",
            "At that rate , the CBO could be $ 250 billion off in 2004 , which exceeds the $ 234 billion surplus it forecasts for that budget year .",
            "`` Estimates for more than five years into the future are even more uncertain , '' the CBO report said .",
            "The projections have been missing on the down side , first by forecasting deficits , then by minimizing surpluses .",
            "The administration forecasts a $ 79 billion surplus when the current budget year ends on Oct. 1 ; that is $ 25 billion more than expected a year ago .",
            "The CBO projects a $ 107 billion surplus this year .",
            "The congressional projection is that surpluses will add up to nearly $ 2.6 trillion over the next decade .",
            "Clinton 's budget projects the total at about $ 2.4 billion .",
            "`` Our estimates , optimistic as they sound , are more conservative than those of Congress , '' the president said .",
            "And longer , by five years , to reach the $ 4.854 trillion Clinton 's budget calls the total reserve by 2014 .",
            "He wants 62 percent of it , $ 2.764 trillion , used for Social Security funding , 15 percent for Medicaid needs , 12 percent for a new system of government-aided retirement savings accounts , and 11 percent for `` military readiness and other critical national needs . ''",
            "That would be all of it , colliding with Republican plans for tax cuts of up to $ 800 billion over the next decade .",
            "`` The number of proposals to get rid of the surplus almost rivals Mark McGwire 's home run record , '' Greenspan said .",
            "Not really ; that was 70 .",
            "But it made his point about competing claims for the money .",
            "He told the Senate Budget Committee caution should rule , given the uncertainty of long-range forecasts and the difficulty of undoing tax and spending commitments .",
            "`` It is not as easy to reduce outlays as it is to increase them , and the reverse is obviously the case in taxes , '' he said .",
            "That would be as true of the new retirement accounts Clinton seeks as of the tax cuts Republicans want .",
            "It 's happened before .",
            "Ronald Reagan 's 1981 income tax cuts did n't produce the economic surge and increased revenues his administration expected , and deficits increased .",
            "A post-Cold War peace dividend was supposed to ease budget pressures a decade ago , but did n't , in part because of economic downturns .",
            "As for long-range forecasting , the last major overhaul of Social Security , in 1983 , was supposed to keep the system solvent until 2057 , but came up 25 years short .",
            "Clinton and Republican leaders agree that gap should be closed using the surplus , although they are at odds how to use the funds .",

            "WASHINGTON _ After George Bush lost the presidency to Bill Clinton in 1992 , some Republicans blamed one of their own : Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board .",
            "Greenspan had first become involved in Republican politics during Richard M. Nixon 's 1968 campaign , and he had been a fixture among the party 's economic policy makers ever since .",
            "He had been appointed Fed chairman by Ronald Reagan and reappointed by Bush .",
            "But in the eyes of Bush 's supporters , Greenspan had committed an unforgivable sin : failing to bring the economy back to full strength quickly enough after the 1990-91 recession .",
            "Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in 1992 , and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was well under way by Election Day .",
            "All of this is to suggest that Greenspan is by no means unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics , or with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue .",
            "And it is already clear , nearly 15 months before Election Day , that Greenspan will figure into this political cycle .",
            "The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats but from Republicans .",
            "In Iowa , where the Republicans battling to stay in the race against Gov .",
            "George W. Bush of Texas for the party 's presidential nomination have become increasingly desperate for attention , both Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have attacked the Fed and Greenspan for raising interest rates when crop prices are plunging and farmers are hurting .",
            "`` Interest rates are too high , and while Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve raise rates , commodity prices have plummeted , '' Forbes says in a 60-second radio spot being run in Iowa .",
            "Forbes goes on to blame monetary policy together with `` bad economic advice from the Clinton-Gore administration '' for the troubles plaguing agriculture .",
            "Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is hardly new ; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party , Greenspan 's ideological home .",
            "Then again , Greenspan is an easy target for politicians of all stripes because he never hits back , at least not publicly .",
            "Perhaps more to the point in this case , some Republicans view Greenspan as having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton administration .",
            "They have watched with some unease over the past six and a half years as Greenspan became chummy first with former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and now with his successor , Lawrence H. Summers , as well as with Clinton himself .",
            "And the party 's more ardent tax cutters were dismayed , if not aghast , when Greenspan told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using projected federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for reducing taxes .",
            "Since Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way _ his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican tax cuts _ Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats .",
            "No one paid much attention to the Fed chairman 's stated preference for tax cuts over additional government spending , which in the eyes of most Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country .",
            "If Congress and the White House fail to work out a deal in the next few months on splitting up the surplus , leaving the issue to be fought out on the campaign trail , Greenspan 's name will no doubt be invoked repeatedly by both parties to bolster their positions .",
            "While fiscal policy can make for powerful politics , it is just a sideline for Greenspan .",
            "The far more compelling issue for him could be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if the economy continues to roar along , setting off inflation alarm bells .",
            "Politically , it will be a tough call ; Greenspan would no doubt prefer to avoid raising rates during a presidential campaign .",
            "Economically , it could prove even trickier , since Greenspan is still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven , financial-market-centric , globally oriented economy can hold off inflation .",
            "Besides a dozen years ' experience on the job and a tough skin , the Fed chairman has something else going for him .",
            "If there were a Bush family grudge against him , it has been put aside , and Governor Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Greenspan 's reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term .",
            "Vice President Al Gore has been equally supportive .",
            "With that bipartisan support , Greenspan has considerable leeway in formulating policy , as well as an opportunity to push ahead with his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions .",
            "In the end , demystifying the institution and making clear that the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation against political attacks ."

            "And in the six years since , first as a top economic adviser and since 1995 as the Treasury secretary , Rubin has gained much credit -- in a close partnership with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- for the policies of spending restraint that kept interest rates low , Wall Street booming and many Americans raking in money .",

            "But with the global financial crisis rapidly changing the economic outlook for the worse , there are growing questions from both the left and the right about the wisdom of putting fiscal rectitude ahead of the potentially more pressing need to sustain growth .",
            "Indeed , with the administration facing the possibility of a recession for the first time since taking office , the White House could face a number of tough choices about whether the market-friendly policies that defined its approach during economic boom times are the best way to approach a more difficult period .",

            "In testimony to the House Banking Committee , Greenspan said the current combination of strong growth , low inflation , declining unemployment and improving efficiency among businesses and workers was unprecedented in the half century he has spent monitoring the economy .",
            "But he stressed that the good times could fall victim to gradually mounting inflation pressures if the Fed did not act to take some steam out of the expansion , which this month became the longest on record at eight years and 11 months .",

            "But his focus was on the risk that the economy was simply too strong for its own good .",
            "The strains on the economy might soon become evident in the labor market , he said , where a rapidly declining pool of jobless workers could force employers to begin raising wages at a pace that could ignite a widespread and destabilizing rise in prices .",
            "But he traced the underlying problem to the stock market .",
            "Buoyant stock prices , he said , were fueling consumer spending and business investment to such a degree that overall demand in the economy was outstripping supply .",
            "The only way to resolve that fundamental imbalance , he said , was to sharply curtail the relentless rise in equity prices .",

            "But as they have repeatedly over the past few years , investors in technology stocks thumbed their noses at Greenspan by driving the Nasdaq index up .",
            "`` There is little evidence that the American economy , which grew more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year , is slowing appreciably , '' Greenspan said at the beginning of his twice-a-year testimony to Congress on the economy and monetary policy .",
            "But some of the very factors underpinning the nation 's remarkable economic performance _ falling joblessness , accelerating productivity , an improved outlook for corporate earnings _ `` are also engendering a set of imbalances that , unless contained , threaten our continuing prosperity , '' Greenspan said .",
            "The pressures on the economy have been eased so far by a surge in imports , which have made up for the inability of domestic producers to keep up with demand , and by the willingness of people who had not previously been in the labor force to get a job .",
            "But those `` safety valves , '' he said , could not contain inflationary pressures forever , especially since the rate increases so far have done little to rein in growth .",
            "The Fed 's policy-setting federal Open Market Committee `` will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply , even should the acceleration of productivity continue , '' Greenspan said .",
            "`` Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier , before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate , lessening the depths of our various buffers against inflationary pressures . ''",
            "Part of rebalancing the economy , he said , would be limiting or ending the rise in stock prices .",
            "`` This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values _ although that , of course , can happen at any time for a number of reasons _ but rather that these values will rise no faster than household incomes , '' Greenspan said ."
