            "Doctors get glowing testimonials from patients , so they tell other patients to try it .",
            "Finally , with about 5 million Americans taking the concoction of crab shells and cow cartilage , enough begin asking how it works _ and enough doctors wonder whether it really does _ that scientists finally begin studying its safety and effectiveness .",
            "That 's what happened with glucosamine and chondroitin , which taken together or separately are now America 's top-selling joint supplements .",
            "The early results of research , including one study just published and another due out soon , suggest the treatment actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further cartilage damage .",
            "The promising research is bound to make the hard-to-pronounce potions , which are available over the counter , even more wildly popular .",
            "`` This is a strange , inverted application of the traditional scientific model , '' said Dr. Timothy McAlindon , an associate professor of medicine at Boston University who has analyzed the evidence on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate , here and abroad .",

            "Dr. Roland Moskowitz , a professor at Case Western Reserve University who next week will help initiate the biggest study ever of glucosamine and chondroitin for the National Institutes of Health , also is bemused by the treatment 's unconventional history .",
            "But he said `` enough people are using it that if it works , we ought to know about it .",
            "And if it does n't , we should know it does n't and stop people from spending money on it .",
            "`` If it works , we 'll have lucked out . ''",
            "Luck has little to do with it if you ask the hordes of horsemen and pet owners across America who have been giving their animals the glucosamine-chondroitin pill since the early 1990s and swear that it quickens the animals ' gait and eases their agony .",
            "Ditto for millions of people in Europe who for even longer have been using the two compounds , which occur naturally in human cartilage and are synthesized in the treatment capsules .",
            "The Europeans even have scientific studies , more than three dozen of them , saying the medicine works .",
            "American researchers have been slower to show an interest , which is largely a function of the way things work here with herbal therapies , dietary supplements and other nonpharmaceutical products .",
            "Given the medicine 's natural derivation , drug companies find it difficult to take out patents on the products , so they have no incentive to sponsor the expensive research to ensure they are effective or safe .",
            "The Food and Drug Administration also steers clear of such remedies .",
            "In the last couple of years , however , American researchers have become curious .",
            "It was partly because of the publication in 1997 of a popular book called `` The Arthritis Cure , '' and the way it triggered an avalanche of interest in glucosamine-chondroitin among America 's 20 million sufferers of the degenerative joint disease called osteoarthritis .",
            "Many were frustrated with the side effects of other medicines and were thrilled with results they got with the new treatment .",
            "Doctors were not about to object since their patients were so convinced and the treatment seemed safe , although over time they started pressing for more concrete evidence .",
            "McAlindon , the BU arthritis specialist , set out to see whether all the European studies held up .",
            "His conclusion , outlined in an article earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association , was that the overseas clinical trials do show that glucosamine and chondroitin reduce pain in osteoarthritis sufferers and are safe .",
            "But nearly all the European trials were supported by manufacturers of the supplements who had the most to gain from positive publicity .",
            "And `` in general they were not that well done , '' McAlindon said last week .",
            "`` They seem to exaggerate the treatments ' efficacy . ''",
            "A series of US studies is trying to weed out those quality problems and come up with definitive answers .",
            "The largest of its kind , published this month in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage , looked at how glucosamine-chondroitin affected pain and movement in 93 patients with arthritic knees .",
            "`` The treatment was significantly more effective than a placebo for pain and function , '' said Dr. Amal Das , a joint replacement surgeon in Hendersonville , N.C. , and the lead author .",
            "That finding is consistent with reports from private physicians nationwide and with the results of other , smaller studies , including one published last year involving 34 Navy personnel suffering from knee or lower back pain .",
            "While the effects on back pain were unclear , that study found , the aching in knees clearly was relieved .",
            "The next question everyone is asking is whether the treatment does more than mask the pain .",
            "Does it actually cure the underlying disease of osteoarthritis ?",
            "And can it help the thousands of young athletes with cartilage damage ?",
            "Logic suggests it might .",
            "Glucosamine in its natural form stimulates cells that make cartilage , while chondroitin sulfate blocks enzymes that break down old cartilage .",
            "The question is whether the same effects are produced by the capsules people take , which generally get glucosamine from crab , lobster , or clam shells and chondroitin from the cartilage in a cow 's trachea .",
            "And , even trickier , can the glucosamine and chondroitin in the pill work their way from the stomach to the blood to the aching knee ?",
            "Animal tests in Arizona offer hope .",
            "Cartilage was removed from rabbits to mimic an injury of the kind humans get , and they were fed glucosamine , chondroitin , and a combination of the two .",
            "After several months , researchers examined the injured area .",
            "`` We found the severity of the arthritis process was less in those given the treatment , '' and the combination of compounds worked best , said Dr. Robert R. Karpman , one of the researchers who oversaw the study in Phoenix , which is due to be published next month .",
            "`` It seems to slow the arthritic process , but it does n't repair the joint surface . ''",
            "However , the Arizona study raises questions .",
            "For instance : could humans tolerate the megadoses given to rabbits ?",
            "Were the beneficial effects a result of stopping further erosion of the cartilage or making new proteins to replace what was gone ?",
            "And can glucosamine and chondroitin really find their way around the stomach and liver not just to a knee or other joint , but to the particular joint that is damaged ?",
            "The fact that cartilage does not have blood vessels , and gets its only nutrition by seepage through the surrounding membrane , probably makes it easier for substances like glucosamine and chondroitin to work their way there , said Dr. Lou Lippiello , director of laboratory research at Nutramax Laboratories , one of the leading manufacturers of the treatment and a partial sponsor of the Hendersonville and Phoenix studies .",
            "`` Apparently it does n't affect normal joints , '' he added .",
            "`` It seems to have an affinity for joints that are undergoing some kind of trauma or stress . ''",
            "Further studies clearly are needed , which is why the NIH next week is scheduled to begin a $ 10 million project involving 1,500 patients .",
            "It will look at glucosamine , chondroitin and the two together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and whether they actually attack the underlying disease .",
            "What should patients do in the meantime ?",
            "Most orthopedic surgeons advise their patients to try it , under a doctor 's guidance .",
            "But it is expensive _ $ 1 or so a day for the eight weeks it takes to begin working , at which point the dosage is lowered and the cost falls to about 60 cents a day .",
            "Insurance generally does not cover the treatment , and physicians caution children and pregnant women not to use it .",
            "Anyone who has diabetes or is taking the blood-thinning drug heparin also should be careful .",

            "But much of the research on glucosamine and chondroitin compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints , according to the analysis in Wednesday 's Journal of the American Medical Association .",

            "Laboratory studies have suggested they might promote cartilage growth , though whether they do in humans remains to be seen , McAlindon said .",
            "The studies he analyzed compared the supplements with a placebo 's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring any changes in joints .",
            "The authors evaluated six studies on glucosamine and nine on chondroitin published between 1966 and 1999 .",

            "''We also found evidence of publication bias , '' McAlindon said , referring to selective publication of the most positive results .",
            "Most , if not all , of the studies were sponsored in some way by the supplements ' makers .",
            "While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments -- aspirin , acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or liver damage , none of the studies showed significant side effects .",

            "Mechanical forces certainly play a role , especially in initiating the damage .",

            "Vitamin C may also facilitate cartilage repair .",
            "Vitamin E , another antioxidant , apparently has less effect on the progression of arthritis , but its anti-inflammatory effects may explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease pain in some patients .",

            "`` Even a little weight loss can make a difference , '' says Brandt , the Indiana arthritis specialist .",
            "Framingham data show that a weight loss of 11 pounds in women of medium height reduced the risk of painful knee arthritis by half .",

            "`` You 'd think I was single-handedly destroying NIH by spending $ 2 million on alternative therapies . ''",

            "Most mainstream scientists , including Varmus , take a dim view of homeopathy .",
            "As a result , said Jonas , who left the institutes at the end of 1998 , he had a difficult time getting approval of proposals to finance research .",
            "But as Congress continued to appropriate more money for the office and public interest grew , Varmus said , `` I came to feel that there was a real public health concern that NIH had a responsibility to address . ''",
            "By 1996 , the alternative medicine office had moved onto the main institutes ' campus , and Varmus had formed an advisory group of government scientists to set priorities .",

            "Celebrex , made by Monsanto 's Searle pharmaceutical unit , on Thursday became the first `` cox-2 '' inhibitor to win Food and Drug Administration approval .",
            "The drugs have been touted as possibly the next wonder pills because of their promise to be easier on patients ' stomachs than existing medications .",
            "But Monsanto was dealt a blow when the FDA declared there is no proof that Celebrex actually is safer for patients ' stomachs than older painkillers .",
            "As a result , when Celebrex hits retail outlets next month it must bear the same warning about side effects as many of its older competitors .",
            "Merck , which is awaiting FDA approval for its Vioxx drug , another cox-2 pill , hopes to get a less stern warning label .",
            "One reason Merck was behind Monsanto in seeking federal approval is because it was waiting for the results of some longer term studies .",
            "The warning label could be a key driver of physician use , and whether either drug reaches the $ 1 billion in annual sales that some Wall Street analysts had forecast .",
            "Merck also hopes to gain another advantage by getting approval for Vioxx to be taken only once a day for arthritis users .",
            "The recommended dose of Celebrex is once or twice a day for osteoarthritis , and twice a day for rheumatoid arthritis .",
            "`` Merck may be able to use Monsanto 's experience to get a better label , '' said Sergio Traversa , an analyst with Mehta Partners in New York .",
            "After the FDA ruling Thursday , shares of Monsanto rose $ 1.19 to $ 47.50 .",
            "Pfizer , which will be co-marketing Celebrex , fell $ 1.12 to $ 125 .",
            "Merck shares dropped $ 1.31 to $ 147.50 .",
            "Merck spokesman John Bloomfield refused to speculate whether the company has enough research results to get a better warning label than Monsanto .",
            "Merck is working closely with the FDA to demonstrate that Vioxx has safety advantages over existing drugs , he said .",

            "Monsanto said it will price Celebrex comparably to other prescription strength painkillers that cost about $ 2.40 a day .",
            "With the traditional safety warnings on Celebrex , Monsanto would have faced considerable difficulty convincing insurers to pay any more .",
            "Despite the warning label issue , the government approval of Celebrex is a boost for Monsanto , which last summer had to drop plans to merge with American Home Products , maker of Robitussin cough syrup and Advil pain reliever .",
            "The $ 33.6 billion marriage would have been the biggest merger ever in the pharmaceutical industry .",
            "Monsanto , based in St. Louis , makes the artificial sweetener Nutrasweet and is also heavily involved in genetic research for agriculture .",

            "And the FDA approval is a boost for Pfizer , who some analysts feared would grow too dependent on its anti-impotence drug Viagra to spur sales growth .",
